    **Specify your PADS4 Server URL:**

    ```
    http://<server>/PADS4/apps/tizen  
    https://<server>/PADS4/apps/tizen  
    ```

    `Replace <server>` with the **IP address** or **domain name** of your **PADS4 Server**.\
    **Ensure "PADS4" is in CAPITAL letters, or the connection will fail due to case sensitivity.**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step Five">
    Click on "Install"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step Six">
    The display will now shhow the PADS4 logo after a minute with the viewer name and connection status and the bottom left of the screen.
