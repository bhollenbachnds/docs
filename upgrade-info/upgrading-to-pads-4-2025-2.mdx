To upgrade to PADS4 2025.2, your current version must be at least 2022.3, meaning PADS4 2022.3 must be installed and running first.

Versions 2022.2 or earlier will not auto-update to 2025.2; an intermediate upgrade to 2022.3 is required.

### **Release Notes**

PADS4 2025.2 release notes are available [[here](https://www.netdisplaysystems.com/downloads/ForwardLinks/PADS4relnotes.pdf)]

## User Management and Migration

User management for PADS4 Workspace and PADS4 CMS 1.0 has been migrated to PADS4 CTRL Center, allowing all users to be managed from a single, centralized location.

This migration includes all PADS4 Workspace and CMS 1.0 users, licenses, and assigned roles, which are automatically transferred to PADS4 CTRL Center during installation. After the installation, you can review the migration process by logging in to the web portal with your Root account and navigating to Migration.

In this section, you’ll find an overview of all migration steps. By selecting an item, you can view detailed information in Migration Run Details or open the Migration Status Report for a full summary.

## Viewer Roles

After the migration is complete, you may not see any viewers listed when you log in, even though all licenses are available. This is because three new roles have been introduced to manage viewer access.

<Warning>
  To view or modify viewer settings, you must have one of the viewer roles assigned to your user account. For more information, see User and Roles in PADS4 CTRL Center → Administrator → User Management.
</Warning>

- TV Element – Replaced by the Streaming element.
