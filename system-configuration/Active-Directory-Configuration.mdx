Many organizations rely on **Microsoft Active Directory** to centrally manage employee user accounts. By integrating **Active Directory (AD)** with **PADS4**, you can seamlessly utilize this existing structure for authentication and user management.  

<Note>PADS4 works with your existing Active Directory structure **without requiring any modifications** to organizational units (OUs) or user groups.</Note>

### **How PADS4 Works with Active Directory**  

Once a connection to **Active Directory** is established, you can create **LDAP users** in PADS4. These users are directly linked to **Active Directory accounts**, ensuring a synchronized and secure authentication process.  

- When an **LDAP user** logs in, **PADS4 automatically authenticates** them using credentials stored in **Active Directory**.  
- Any changes to **usernames or passwords** in Active Directory are **instantly reflected** in PADS4.  
- If a user **account is disabled** in Active Directory, they **will no longer be able to log in** to PADS4.  
- When a user is **removed from Active Directory**, they are **automatically deleted** from PADS4.  
- If the **PADS4 Server** has limited permissions for accessing Active Directory, updates from AD **may not take effect immediately** and will be applied **after a server restart**.

> **Important:** Removing an **LDAP user** from PADS4 **does not delete** their account from **Active Directory**.

### **Managing Users & Permissions**  

All **user group memberships, permissions, and license assignments** are managed within **PADS4**, including for LDAP users.  

If the **Active Directory connection** is **disabled**, the previously created **LDAP users remain active** in PADS4. This allows you to **reuse them** if you re-enable the AD connection in the future.

## **Configuring Active Directory in PADS4**  

To integrate **Active Directory** with **PADS4**, follow these steps:  

1️. **Configure the Active Directory connection settings**  
   - Open the **Server Settings** window in **PADS4 System Management**.  
   - Enter the required **Active Directory connection details**.  

2️. **Restart the PADS4 Server**  
   - This ensures the **Active Directory connection settings take effect**.  

3️. **Create LDAP users**  
   - Navigate to the **Users** window in **PADS4 System Management**.  
   - Create **one or more LDAP users** linked to **Active Directory accounts**.  

4️. **Assign user groups & licenses**  
   - Ensure users are **assigned to the appropriate user groups**.  
   - Assign the necessary **licenses** to each user.

## **Final Steps**  

**Your Active Directory integration is now complete!**  
Users can **log in using their Active Directory credentials**.  
**User authentication & updates** are **automated** and **seamless**.  

By leveraging **Active Directory with PADS4**, organizations can maintain **centralized user management**, improve **security**, and **simplify authentication** without modifying their existing **Active Directory structure**.
