title: "PADS4 hardware requirements"
---

This document outlines the hardware requirements for running PADS4 effectively. Additional performance guidelines are included to optimize your setup. NDS assumes no responsibility or liability for any errors or omissions in this document. The information is provided “as is” without guarantees of completeness, accuracy, usefulness, or timeliness.

Hardware needs vary based on system purpose—static content requires fewer resources than full multimedia deployments.

## PADS4 Platform Server requirements

Requirements scale with the number of Viewers. Use Backup and Sub-Servers for systems over 1000 Viewers; contact [support@pads4.com](mailto:support@pads4.com) for guidance.

| Viewer quantity | CPU      | Memory | Application storage | Content storage | OS                                   | Data server max. quantity |
| --------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1 - 100         | 4 cores  | 16Gb   | 2Gb                 | 16Gb            | Windows Server 2019, 64bit and above | 25                        |
| 100 - 500       | 8 cores  | 16Gb   | 2Gb                 | 64Gb            | Windows Server 2019, 64bit and above | 25                        |
| 500             | 8 cores  | 24Gb   | 2Gb                 | 64Gb            | Windows Server 2019, 64bit and above | 100                       |
| 1000\*          | 16 cores | 32Gb   | 2Gb                 | 256Gb           | Windows Server 2019, 64bit and above | 200                       |

\*For \>1000 Viewers, strongly recommend Backup/Sub-Servers.

## General performance tips

Follow these guidelines for optimal PADS4 performance during configuration and operation.

| Component           | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disk                | Use SSDs to speed up content synchronization, which heavily impacts server performance.                                                         |
| Virus scanners      | Exclude PADS4 folders from scanning to avoid slowdowns in content sync and processes.                                                           |
| Virtual Server      | Assign a static MAC address; dynamic ones disrupt licensing during restarts.                                                                    |
| Network             | Ensure stable 100 Mbps+ (1 Gbps preferred) for best results.                                                                                    |
| Content storage     | Size depends on needs; SSDs boost server and Viewer speed. Resize 4K media to Full HD specs for HD displays to cut bandwidth and playback load. |
| Content permissions | Limit sync to relevant Viewer/User groups to reduce unnecessary transfers.                                                                      |
| Data Server         | Retrieve only needed data (limit rows/columns); avoid tiny read intervals unless data changes in real time to save CPU and bandwidth.           |

## PADS4 Viewer hardware requirements

Below table are the specifications for the PADS4 viewers and viewer types.

| Viewer type                        | CPU     | RAM | App storage | Content storage | OS               | Data providers |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | --- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Windows Viewer - (minimum specs)   | 2 cores | 2Gb | 2Gb         | 16Gb            | Windows 10 64bit | 25             |
| Windows Viewer (recommended specs) | 4 cores | 4Gb | 2Gb         | 128Gb           | Windows 10 64bit | 50             |
| Android Viewer (recommended specs) | NA      | 4Gb | 1Gb         | 4Gb             | Android          | NA             |
