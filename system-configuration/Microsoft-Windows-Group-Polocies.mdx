Many organizations use Microsoft Group Policies to centrally manage settings for the users. With the Group Policies of Microsoft you can centrally manage the Desktop Viewer settings.

PADS4 has implemented group policies for the Desktop Viewer application to allow the administrator to specify the settings from a central location and push these settings towards 1 or more users or user groups. The policies set by the administrator are automatically detected by the Desktop Viewer options window and those options are disabled in the user interface. This way it is possible to push a set of predefined settings towards users, and still give them the opportunity to change some settings locally.

The pushed settings are stored in the registry under:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Net Display Systems\PADS4


The 'normal settings' are stored in the registry under: 

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Net Display Systems\PADS4
