The **Rooms** tab provides an overview of all rooms that have been added to the **PADS4 Workspace Module**. From this tab, you can add, remove, and modify rooms as needed.

## Adding a Room

To add a room to the PADS4 Workspace module, you can choose from two options:

### Import Rooms  
This option queries the connected calendar (e.g., Microsoft Exchange) to retrieve room resource information. Once the query is complete, a list of available rooms will be shown, allowing you to select which rooms to add to the system.

### Manual Room Creation  
You can also manually create a room that is not part of the connected calendar by selecting the manual creation option.
