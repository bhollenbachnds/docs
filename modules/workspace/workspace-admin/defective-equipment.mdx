The **Defective Equipment** tab provides administrators with an overview of all equipment reported as faulty within the PADS4 Workspace module.

## Viewing and Managing Faulty Equipment

Administrators can select any listed equipment item to view detailed information, including:

- **Room Name** – Where the faulty equipment is located  
- **Equipment** – The item that was reported  
- **Reporter** – The user who submitted the report  

Once the issue has been addressed (repaired or replaced), the equipment can be marked as **repaired**, removing it from the defective list and restoring it to normal availability.
