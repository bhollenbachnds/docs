PADS4 Workspace allows users to **search for colleagues** to see where they are scheduled to workâ€”if this feature is enabled by your administrators.

This functionality helps employees locate co-workers in shared environments or coordinate meetings and desk usage.

### **Step 2: Select a Colleague and Time Period**

1. Use the **directory** on the left to find and select a colleague.  
2. Choose a **time period** to view their scheduled workspace reservations and availability.

This view shows you where the selected person will be and helps you find the best time and place to collaborate.
