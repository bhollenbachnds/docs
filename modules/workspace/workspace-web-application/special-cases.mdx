This section outlines advanced workspace scenarios that may involve specific configurations, approvals, or delegated access.

### **Modular Rooms**

PADS4 Workspace supports **modular meeting rooms**, which are rooms that can be combined or separated using movable partitions.

If configured by administrators, users can:

- Book one of the individual rooms  
- Or book the combined, larger room as a whole

This setup is common for flexible training areas or boardrooms that can be resized as needed.

### **Booking Approval Workflow**

Some rooms may require **booking approval**. In this case:

- The requester books a room as usual  
- The request is sent to an **approver**  
- The reservation remains **pending** until it’s approved  
- Upon approval, the room is officially booked and confirmed  

> Detailed steps are described in the **Appendix: Booking Approval Workflow**

### **Booking Request Workflow**

In some configurations, users are only allowed to **submit a booking request** rather than select a specific room.

- The requester fills in desired criteria (e.g., date, equipment, services)  
- A **room manager** reviews the request  
- Based on the criteria, the manager assigns a suitable room and confirms the reservation

> Full process explained in the **Appendix: Booking Request Workflow**

### **Delegation**

PADS4 Workspace allows **delegation**, where one user can manage bookings on behalf of another.

This is useful for:

- Executive assistants managing calendars  
- Team leads booking on behalf of their group

Once set up, the delegate can view and book through the other user’s calendar.
