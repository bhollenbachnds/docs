Once your message is complete and previewed, the final step is to publish it. Publishing involves defining when and where the message should appear.

The publishing process is divided into three main steps:

---

## Step 01: Title

In this step, you provide a title for your message.

- **Title**: Enter a descriptive name that helps identify the message in the CMS.
- This title is for internal use and will not be displayed on the screen.
- Ensure the name is meaningful so that other users or administrators can easily recognize it.

Once done, click **Next** to proceed.

---

## Step 02: Date & Recurrences

Here you define when the message should be shown.

- **Start Date & Time**: When the message should begin displaying.
- **End Date & Time**: When the message should stop displaying.
- **Recurrence Options** *(if applicable)*:
  - **Daily, Weekly, or Custom** recurrence patterns can be configured to automate message repetition.

This step ensures your content displays at the right time without manual intervention.

## Step 03: Viewers

In this final step, you select where the message will be shown.

- **Viewers or Viewer Groups**: Choose one or more screens (or screen groups) where the message will appear.
- A list of available Viewers is shown; select the appropriate destination(s) based on your intended audience or location.

After selecting your Viewers, click **Publish** to complete the process.

Your message is now scheduled and will display according to the settings you defined.
