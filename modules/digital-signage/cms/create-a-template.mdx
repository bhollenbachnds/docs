Templates serve as the foundation for messages created in PADS4 CMS. They define the layout, design, and editable areas of content that end users will use to create and publish messages.

## Presentation of the Interface

Once inside the Web Designer, the interface is divided into key areas:

- **Canvas Area**: The main design space where you place and arrange elements.
- **Toolbar**: Provides access to drawing tools, media insertion, alignment, and layer management.
- **Property Panel**: Located on the right, it displays configuration options for the selected element (e.g., size, color, alignment).
- **Layer Panel**: Lists all objects on the template, allowing you to reorder, group, or delete elements.

## Enlarge the Main Page

To zoom or maximize the workspace:
