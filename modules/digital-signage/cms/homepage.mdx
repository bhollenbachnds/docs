After selecting **Digital Signage**, you will be taken to the main home page of the PADS4 CMS Designer.

## Presentation of the Interface

The CMS Designer home page is organized into a clean and user-friendly layout, designed to make content creation and management intuitive. The interface is divided into several functional sections:

### Header Bar  
Located at the top of the screen, this area provides access to:
- Navigation buttons
- Account settings
- Language selection
- Logout option

### Navigation Menu  
Typically found on the left-hand side, this menu includes:
- **Categories**: For managing content groupings
- **Templates**: For creating and editing reusable designs
- **Messages**: For scheduling and publishing content
- **Library**: For managing images and media files
- **Publications**: For reviewing and modifying published content
- **Options**: For personal or system preferences

### Workspace Area  
The central section of the interface displays content based on the selection from the navigation menu. This is where users create and edit templates or messages, preview content, and manage publication details.

The layout is designed to separate design and content responsibilitiesâ€”allowing template designers and content editors to work independently in a streamlined workflow.
