### Navigation Menu

Found on the left-hand side, this menu includes:

- **New message**: For creating and editing reusable designs / templates
- **Publications**: For reviewing and modifying published content
- **Diagnostics**: For viewer diagnostics 
- **Library**: For managing images and media files

### Workspace Area

The central section of the interface displays content based on the selection from the navigation menu. This is where users create and edit templates or messages, preview content, and manage publication details.

The layout is designed to separate design and content responsibilities—allowing template designers and content editors to work independently in a streamlined workflow.
