## Dark Theme

For a more comfortable visual experience—especially in low-light environments—you can switch to a **Dark Theme**.

- To enable dark mode:
  1. Go to the user preferences or display settings.
  2. Select **Dark Theme**.
  3. The interface colors will adjust accordingly.

This option helps reduce eye strain and may also help conserve energy on certain display types.
