The **Publications** section in PADS4 CMS Designer gives you an overview of all published messages, both active and scheduled. From here, you can manage existing content, edit messages, and export materials if needed.

## List of Messages

Upon accessing the **Publications** menu, you will see a list of all created and scheduled messages.

Each entry typically displays:

- **Message Title**
- **Template Used**
- **Start/End Date and Time**
- **Assigned Viewer(s)**
- **Status** (Active, Scheduled, Expired)

You can scroll or navigate through pages to find specific entries.

## Edit a Message / Filter the List

To manage or locate specific messages more efficiently:

- **Filter the List**:
  - Use the search bar to filter by keyword.
  - Use drop-down filters (if available) to sort by category, date, or viewer.
  
- **Edit a Message**:
  1. Locate the message you want to update.
  2. Click on the **Edit** button next to the message.
  3. Youâ€™ll be taken back to the message creation screen where you can update content, dates, or assigned viewers.
  4. Save and re-publish as needed.

This allows for fast corrections or updates without needing to recreate the message from scratch.

## PDF / PowerPoint

PADS4 CMS Designer allows you to export messages into alternative formats:

- **Export to PDF**:
  - Click on the **Export PDF** button to generate a printable version of the message.
  - Useful for documentation, archiving, or offline review.

- **Export to PowerPoint**:
  - Click on the **Export PowerPoint** button to create a slide version of your message.
  - Helpful for presentations or sharing with stakeholders not using the CMS.

These options help bridge the gap between on-screen content and offline communication needs.
