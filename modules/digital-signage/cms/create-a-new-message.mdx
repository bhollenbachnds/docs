Creating a message in PADS4 CMS Designer is the process of combining a pre-designed template with dynamic or static content. Messages are what ultimately get published to screens.

## Categories & Templates

1. Navigate to the **Messages** section from the main navigation menu.
2. Click **Create New Message**.
3. You’ll be prompted to:
   - **Select a Category**: Choose the appropriate category to organize the message.
   - **Select a Template**: Pick from existing templates available in that category.

Once selected, the message creation page will load with your chosen template.

## Message Creation Page

This page is where you fill in the content that will be displayed in your selected template. The editable areas of the template are defined during template creation and will be clearly marked.

---

## Fields to Fill

Each editable area in the template will display input fields. Depending on the design, these fields may include:

- **Text fields** (e.g., title, subtitle, description)
- **Image or video placeholders**
- **Date/time selectors**
- **Dropdowns or checkboxes** for customized options

Simply enter or select the content required in each field.

## Change a Media

To change an image or video in a media placeholder:

1. Click on the media area or its associated **Change Media** button.
2. Choose from:
   - **Upload a new file**
   - **Select from the Library**

The selected file will be inserted into the template and reflected immediately in the preview.

## Add Multiple Media (Drag and Drop)

You can add multiple media files simultaneously using drag-and-drop:

1. Drag images or videos from your desktop or folder directly into the message editor.
2. Files will upload and populate the respective fields in your message.
3. You can reassign or replace them as needed.

This is especially useful when dealing with templates that feature multiple visual elements.

## Preview

Before publishing:

1. Click the **Preview** button to view your message in real time.
2. The preview will reflect your current input and layout.
3. Use this opportunity to confirm alignment, formatting, and content accuracy.

Once satisfied with the preview, you’re ready to proceed to the publishing steps.
