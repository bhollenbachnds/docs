The **Ordering** functionality in PADS4 CMS Designer allows administrators and authorized users to control the sequence in which templates and messages appear. This is especially important in environments where order impacts visibility or scheduling priority.

## Specific Rights Needed

Reordering templates and messages is a permission-controlled feature.

- Only users with the appropriate **administrative rights** or **content management permissions** can reorder items.
- If you do not see the reorder option, please contact your system administrator to request access or adjust your user profile.

## Change the Order of Templates and Messages

To change the order:

1. Navigate to the **Templates** or **Messages** section.
2. Locate the list view of existing templates or messages within a category.
3. Use the **drag-and-drop** functionality to move items up or down in the list.
   - Simply click and hold an item, drag it to the desired position, and release.
4. The new order will be automatically saved or require confirmation depending on system configuration.

**Why use ordering?**

- Organize content logically (e.g., by frequency of use, importance, or departments).
- Control the default selection order for users creating new messages.
- Prioritize specific messages in playlists or multi-message scenarios.

This feature provides greater control and consistency for managing high-volume or time-sensitive content.
