Categories in PADS4 CMS Designer are used to organize templates and messages. They help maintain a structured environment, especially when managing content across multiple departments, locations, or use cases.

## Create a New Category

To create a new category:

1. Navigate to the **Categories** section in the main navigation menu.
2. Click the **Create a new category** button.
3. In the form that appears, enter the following details:
   - **Category Name**: The name that will be used to identify this category.
   - **Description** *(optional)*: A short explanation of what this category is for.
4. Click **Save** to create the category.

Once created, the category will appear in the list and can be used to organize templates and messages. Categories can also help define user permissions and streamline message creation by grouping related content together.
