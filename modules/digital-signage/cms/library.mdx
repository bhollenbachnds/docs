## Options

Within the Library, several tools are available for managing assets:

- **Upload Media**: Allows you to add new images, videos, and files from your device.
- **Search Bar**: Quickly find templates or media using keywords.
- **Sort Options**: Organize assets by name, date, type, or category.
- **Filters**: Filter by file type (e.g., image, video, PDF) or by category.

These tools help streamline the asset selection process, especially in larger content libraries.

## Change the View

You can adjust how assets are displayed in the Library:

- Choose between **Grid View** (thumbnail-based) or **List View** (detailed, file-style layout).
- This option is usually available at the top right of the Library interface.

Grid View is helpful for visual selection, while List View is better for managing file details and batch operations.

## Select an Existing Template

To use an existing template from the Library:

1. Browse or search for the template you wish to use.
2. Click on the template thumbnail or name to open it.
3. You can preview the layout, and if it suits your needs, you can proceed to create a new message based on it.

Existing templates help ensure design consistency and save time when publishing frequent or recurring content.
