The **homepage** of the PADS4 Visitor Management System (VMS) provides an overview of active and pre-registered visitors, system actions, and access to core features such as **user creation**, **archives**, and **settings**.

This central dashboard serves as your starting point for managing guest entries, configuring the environment, and handling day-of check-ins.

## On-Site Registration (VMS Kiosk Link)

For on-site self-check-in:

Deploy **interactive tablets, laptops, or PADS4 Viewers** with browsers configured to open the **VMS Kiosk URL**:

```
https://yourpads4domain.com/VMS/Kiosk/welcome
```
or
```
http://<public-ip>/VMS/Kiosk/welcome
```

> **Important (PADS4 version 2022.3 and newer):**  
Use the **correct domain-specific URL structure** to avoid licensing issues in multi-domain environments:
```
https://serverlocation/VMS/Kiosk/domain
```
For single-domain environments:
```
https://serverlocation/VMS/Kiosk/pads
```

## QR Code or PIN Check-In

Visitors can check in using either:

- A **QR Code** (camera-enabled devices required)
- A **randomly assigned PIN**

> Browsers will request permission to access the camera if QR code scanning is used. Supported browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer.

Once a user is registered, the following actions are available via the **Action Button**:

### For All Registered Users:
