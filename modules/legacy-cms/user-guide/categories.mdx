Categories are used to organize your digital signage content. Think of them as folders or themes that help you manage different types of content based on location, department, event, or any other classification relevant to your organization.

### Creating a New Category

To create a new category:

1. **Navigate to the ‘Categories’ section**  
   Use the main navigation menu to select **Categories**.

2. **Click 'Create Category' or the Add (+) button**  
   This will open a form to define the new category.

3. **Fill in the required fields**:
   - **Name**: Give your category a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Lobby Screens", "HR Announcements").
   - **Description** (optional): Add context for what this category is for.
   - **Permissions** (if applicable): Assign access rights based on user roles or departments.

4. **Save the category**  
   Your new category will now appear in the list and be available when creating messages or assigning masks.

### Managing Existing Categories

- **Edit**: Click on a category to update its name or settings.
- **Delete**: Remove unused or obsolete categories (note: some systems may restrict deletion if the category contains active content).
- **Search / Filter**: Use the search bar to find categories quickly if you manage a large content library.

Organizing your content with categories ensures better visibility, easier management, and a more efficient workflow—especially when working with multiple teams or locations.
