After logging in and selecting the **Digital Signage** module, you’ll be directed to the homepage. This is your main dashboard for managing the entire digital signage system.

### Interface Overview

The homepage is divided into several areas, each offering access to key features and functions:

- **Navigation Menu** (usually on the left or top):  
  Provides access to all modules such as Categories, Masks, Messages, Content, and more.

- **Main Workspace**:  
  Displays the selected module's content. This is where you’ll view, create, and manage items depending on the tab you’ve selected.

- **User Profile / Logout**:  
  You can view your user details or log out of the session from the top-right corner.

### Key Features on the Homepage

- **Quick Access Tiles or Buttons** (if available):  
  These shortcuts allow you to jump directly into creating new messages, reviewing recent content, or managing broadcasts.

- **System Feedback / Notifications**:  
  If there are any system messages, alerts, or reminders (like upcoming broadcast schedules), they may appear here.

The homepage acts as your central control panel, allowing you to switch easily between different administrative tasks while keeping track of what’s active on your network.
