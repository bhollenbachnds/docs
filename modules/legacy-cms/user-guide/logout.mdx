Logging out of the Crystal Digital Signage CMS ensures that your session is securely closed and prevents unauthorized access, especially when working on a shared or public device.

### How to Log Out

1. **Locate the user menu**  
   In most cases, the logout option is found at the top right corner of the interface, usually near your username or profile indicator.

2. **Click 'Logout'**  
   Selecting this will immediately end your session and return you to the login screen.

3. **Confirmation (if applicable)**  
   Some systems may prompt you to confirm the logout action before ending the session.

### Best Practices

- **Always log out** when you are done using the CMS, particularly if you're working on a shared device or in a public environment.
- Logging out also ensures that system changes or updates are properly saved and closed before exiting.

Once logged out, you can log back in at any time using your credentials and continue managing your digital signage environment.
