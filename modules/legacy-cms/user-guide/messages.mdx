Messages are the actual content pieces that get displayed on your screens. They are created using a combination of categories and masks, and typically include text, images, or media elements depending on the layout defined in the mask.

### Creating a New Message

To create a message:

1. **Go to the ‘Messages’ section**  
   Select **Messages** from the main navigation menu.

2. **Click 'Create Message' or the Add (+) button**  
   This will open the message creation page.

3. **Select a Category and a Mask**  
   - Choose the appropriate **Category** to organize your message.
   - Select a **Mask** that determines the layout of the message.

4. **Fill in the message fields**  
   The fields available will depend on the mask you’ve selected. Common input types include:
   - **Text areas**
   - **Image uploads**
   - **Video links or uploads**
   - **Scrolling text**
   - **Dynamic elements** (e.g., time, date, weather)

5. **Customize each content area**  
   Input or upload the required media and text into the predefined zones.

6. **Save your message**  
   The message will now appear in the list and can be previewed, edited, or published.

### Managing Messages

- **Edit**: Open any message to update its content.
- **Delete**: Remove messages that are no longer needed.
- **Search / Filter**: Use the filters to quickly locate messages by category, mask, or date.
- **Sort**: You can sort the message list by date, title, or other available columns.

Messages can be previewed before publishing to ensure they appear as intended.
