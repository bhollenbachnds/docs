The **Text Area** module allows administrators to manage predefined text blocks or dynamic text snippets that can be reused across multiple messages. This is particularly useful for standardized messages, legal disclaimers, or frequently updated announcements.

### Accessing the Text Area Module

1. **Go to the ‘Text Area’ section**  
   Select **Text Area** from the main navigation menu.

2. **View existing text blocks**  
   You’ll see a list of all stored text snippets, each associated with a title or identifier.

### Creating or Editing Text Blocks

1. **Click 'Add' or 'New Text'**  
   This opens the editor interface.

2. **Enter a name or title**  
   Give your text block a unique and descriptive name so it’s easy to identify.

3. **Input your text content**  
   - Use the built-in editor to enter or format your text
   - Supports basic formatting: bold, italics, lists, alignment, etc.
   - You may also insert variables or dynamic data if supported

4. **Save the text area**  
   Once saved, the text area becomes available for use in messages.

### Using Text Areas in Messages

When editing a message that includes a **Text Area** zone (as defined by the mask), you can select from the list of available text blocks instead of typing new content. This ensures consistency and simplifies updates across multiple screens.

### Managing Text Areas

- **Edit**: Update the content of an existing text area at any time.
- **Delete**: Remove unused or obsolete text areas.
- **Search**: Quickly find a text area by name using the search bar.

This feature is ideal for organizations that display recurring announcements or need to ensure compliance with pre-approved text.
