The **History** module provides a complete audit trail of messages that have been published through the system. This section helps administrators track what content was shown, when, and on which screens.

### Accessing the History Module

1. **Navigate to the ‘History’ section**  
   Select **History** from the navigation menu.

2. **View the broadcast log**  
   The interface displays a chronological list of previously published messages. Each entry includes:
   - **Message title**
   - **Start and end time**
   - **Targeted viewers**
   - **Status** (e.g., completed, expired, canceled)

### Filtering and Searching

Use filters to narrow down the history list:
- **By date range**
- **By message title**
- **By viewer or group**
- **By category**

This allows you to quickly find specific events or verify that content was displayed according to plan.

### Exporting History

In some systems, the history data can be exported for reporting or archiving purposes. Options may include:
- CSV or Excel export
- Printable reports

This is particularly useful for compliance tracking or internal review.

### Why Use History?

- **Audit compliance**: Confirm what content was displayed and when.
- **Troubleshooting**: Investigate whether a message was properly delivered.
- **Analytics**: Review broadcast patterns and improve scheduling strategy.
