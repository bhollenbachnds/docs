The **Broadcast** module is used to distribute messages to designated screens or groups of screens. This is where you finalize and send out your content so that it appears on the digital signage network.

### Accessing the Broadcast Module

1. **Navigate to the ‘Broadcast’ section**  
   Select **Broadcast** from the main menu.

2. **View pending or scheduled messages**  
   This section displays all messages that are either waiting to be published, scheduled for future broadcast, or currently active.

### Broadcasting a Message

To publish a message to your screens:

1. **Select the message to broadcast**  
   Choose from the list of saved messages in your library.

2. **Configure broadcast options**:
   - **Start and End Date/Time**: Define when the message should begin and stop displaying.
   - **Recurrence** (if needed): Choose repeat settings—daily, weekly, or custom patterns.
   - **Target Viewers**: Select one or multiple screens (viewers) or groups of screens to receive the message.

3. **Review and confirm**  
   Make sure all settings are correct, and click **Publish** or **Confirm Broadcast**.

### Managing Broadcasts

- **Edit**: Adjust scheduling or viewer targets for already scheduled broadcasts.
- **Cancel or Delete**: Remove a broadcast before or during its active window.
- **Filter**: Sort broadcasts by status, date, or assigned viewers to manage multiple campaigns more effectively.

Broadcasting is the final step in the content delivery process and ensures that your carefully created messages reach the right screens at the right time.
