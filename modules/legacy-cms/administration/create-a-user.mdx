After creating one or more profiles, you can add users and assign them the appropriate profile based on their role within the system.

### Steps to Create a User

1. In the Administrator interface, go to the **Users** section.

2. Click on the option to **Create New User**.

3. Complete the user details:
   - **Username**: The login name the user will use.
   - **Password**: Create a secure password for the user.
   - **Email** (optional): Useful for notifications or password recovery, if supported.

4. Assign a **Profile** to the user. This will determine their permissions within the system.

5. Specify additional settings, if available:
   - Language preference
   - Time zone
   - Account status (active/inactive)

6. Click **Save** to add the user to the system.

### Notes

- Users cannot access the platform without an assigned profile.
- User accounts can be edited or deactivated at any time by an administrator.
- Password policies should be followed as per organizational requirements.
