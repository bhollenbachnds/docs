Once you have completed your tasks in the Crystal Administrator interface, it is important to log out to ensure the security of your sessionâ€”especially if you are working on a shared or public device.

### Steps to Logout

1. Navigate to the top right corner of the interface, where your username or account options are typically displayed.

2. Select the **Logout** option from the dropdown menu or account menu.

3. The system will end your session and return you to the login screen.

### Notes

- Logging out helps prevent unauthorized access.
- Unsaved changes may be lost if you log out before completing certain tasks.
- Always log out before closing your browser to fully terminate your session.
