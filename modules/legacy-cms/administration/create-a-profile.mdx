Before users can be added to the system, at least one **profile** must be created. A profile determines what access rights and permissions a user will have within the Crystal Digital Signage system.

### Steps to Create a Profile

1. From the Administrator interface, navigate to the **Profiles** section.

2. Select the option to **Create New Profile**.

3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Name**: Give the profile a clear and descriptive name (for example, "Content Editor" or "Administrator").
   - **Description** (optional): Add details to help identify the purpose or scope of the profile.

4. Set permissions by enabling or disabling access to various modules such as:
   - Message creation
   - Category management
   - Scheduling
   - Media library access
   - Administrative settings

5. Once all relevant settings are configured, click **Save** to store the profile.

### Notes

- You can create multiple profiles for different user roles.
- Profiles can be edited or deleted at any time.
- Only users with the appropriate rights can create or modify profiles.
