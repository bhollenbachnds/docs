## Media Prerequisites

Before uploading and using media files within the Crystal Digital Signage system, it's important to ensure that your content meets the platform's technical requirements. Following these guidelines ensures compatibility, performance, and reliability across all displays.

### Supported Media Formats

Crystal supports a range of file formats, including but not limited to:

- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF
- **Videos**: MP4 (H.264), WMV
- **Audio**: MP3
- **Documents**: PDF (when supported by templates or widgets)

### Recommended File Specifications

To ensure optimal playback and minimize performance issues:

- **Images**: Keep resolution within the display's native resolution (e.g., 1920x1080 for Full HD).
- **Videos**: Use H.264 encoding with AAC audio. Limit resolution and bitrate based on the display hardware.
- **File Size**: Large files may impact loading time or playback. Compress media where possible without sacrificing quality.

### Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive filenames.
- Avoid special characters and spaces; prefer hyphens or underscores.

### Upload Guidelines

- Upload media through the designated **Library** or **Media** section in the Administrator interface.
- Ensure that uploaded files are placed in the correct folders or categories for easy organization and retrieval.

### Notes

- Unsupported file types may not upload or play correctly.
- If issues arise with playback, verify the media specifications and consult technical support or documentation for advanced encoding recommendations.
