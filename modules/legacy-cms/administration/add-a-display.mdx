Displays represent the physical or virtual screens where digital signage content is shown. Each display must be registered in the system to receive and show scheduled content.

### Steps to Add a Display

1. Navigate to the **Displays** section in the Administrator interface.

2. Select the option to **Add New Display**.

3. Enter the required information:
   - **Display Name**: A unique and descriptive name to identify the screen (for example, "Lobby TV" or "Meeting Room Screen").
   - **Location** (optional): Helps organize and manage screens by their physical placement.
   - **Group** (if applicable): Assign the display to an existing group for bulk scheduling or management.

4. Note the **Display Token** or **Activation Code** generated by the system. This will be used to activate the player software on the physical screen.

5. Install the digital signage player software on the screen or device.

6. Launch the player and enter the token/code to pair the display with your system.

7. Once connected, the display will appear as online in the Administrator interface and can begin receiving content.

### Notes

- A display must be connected to the internet or the local network to communicate with the CMS.
- Displays can be organized into groups for easier scheduling.
- You can edit or remove displays at any time.
