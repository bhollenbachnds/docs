## Database Configuration

### Microsoft SQL Server

- SQL Server Management Studio (GUI-based)  
- SQL statements  
- PowerShell script

---

### Server Name

- Choose the SQL Server instance to be used.  
- When the dropdown is opened, allow a few seconds for the list to populate.

### Authentication

- If **SQL Server Authentication** is selected, provide the **username** and **password**.  
- Again, allow a few seconds for credential fields to populate if using dropdowns.

### Database Name

- Select or enter the name of the **PADS4FIDS database**.  
- If the database does not exist, PADS4 will attempt to create it once settings are saved.

> If the selected database is not already a valid PADS4FIDS database, the existing structure will be overwritten and all current data will be deleted.

## Flight Remover Settings

These settings control how long operational flight data is retained in the system.

### **Remove Flights After X Days**

- Define the number of days after which completed or expired flights should be deleted from the operational database.

### **Archive Flights on Removal**

- Optionally, specify the name of an **archive database** where old flights should be stored.
- If no archive is defined, the flights will be **permanently deleted** and cannot be recovered.
