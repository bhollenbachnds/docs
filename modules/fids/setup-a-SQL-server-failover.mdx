To ensure high availability and system redundancy, PADS4FIDS supports a **failover configuration** using two PADS4 servers with a shared SQL database and a DNS API switcher.

This setup ensures that if one PADS4 server becomes unavailable, the system can automatically redirect to the secondary server with minimal disruption.

## Overview

- **SQL Database**: Hosted on a separate server (not on either PADS4 server)  
- **Two PADS4FIDS Servers**: Installed on separate machines  
- **DNS API Switcher**: Automatically redirects traffic between primary and secondary servers  
- **Unified Access**: Viewers and operators use a common DNS address

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Prepare the SQL Database

- Set up a **SQL Server** on a dedicated machine in your network.  
- Follow the standard steps for **creating a PADS4FIDS database** on this server.  
- Ensure both PADS4 servers will have access to this SQL Server.

---

### Step 2: Install Two PADS4FIDS Servers

- Deploy **two separate PADS4FIDS servers** (on two virtual or physical machines).  
- These servers will **share the same licensing**, but you must contact the **PADS4 Sales Team** to authorize this configuration.  
- Refer to the official **PADS4 installation manual** for setup instructions.

---

### Step 3: Install a DNS API Switcher

- Install the **DNS API Switcher** on a machine that is **not one of the PADS4 servers**.  
- This machine can be the SQL server or another system that can **communicate with both PADS4 servers and all PADS4 Viewers**.  
- Configure the DNS API Switcher to:
  - Use the **primary PADS4 server** as the default endpoint
  - Automatically switch to the **secondary server** if the primary becomes unreachable

---

### Step 4: Configure Viewers and Operator Access

- Configure all **PADS4 Viewers** to use the **DNS address** from the API switcher instead of a fixed server IP.  
- The DNS address should be entered as the **PADS4 Server IP** in viewer connection settings.  
- Default ports remain unchanged unless otherwise specified:
  - **Port 80** (HTTP)
  - **Port 7237** (PADS4 communication)

- Users accessing the **PADS4FIDS Operator** must also use the **DNS address** to ensure continuity, regardless of which server is active.
