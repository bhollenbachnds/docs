The root access interface in PADS4 is a compact dashboard designed for system-level administration. It typically contains three main sections: **Diagnostics**, **Migration**, and **Domains**.

## Diagnostics

The Diagnostics section lets you check whether the PADS4 system is healthy.

- It runs a series of tests against the different PADS4 services.
- Results are shown per service, so you can see which component is functioning correctly and which one needs attention.
- This helps quickly identify configuration issues or service outages before you proceed with further setup or changes.

## Migration

The Migration section is used when a migration step is required during the setup or upgrade process.

- It provides an overview of the migration status and shows progress while data or settings are being migrated.
- You can monitor whether the migration has started, is in progress, or has completed successfully, which helps ensure the environment is ready before you continue configuring domains.

## Domains

PADS4 Domains provide multi-tenant management capabilities within a single PADS4 server.

- Each domain operates as an independent client environment with its own users, content, and configurations.
- From the root interface, you can create new domains, modify the default "pads" domain, or manage domain-specific SSL certificates and DNS settings.
- This section is the central hub for domain administration at the server level.
