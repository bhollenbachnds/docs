title: "PADS4 Root User Overview"
---

The root user in PADS4 is a superuser account with elevated privileges for managing domains and server-wide configurations. It is automatically created during the PADS4 installation process using the PADS4 Foundation Configuration Tool, where you set its password.

## **Access Requirements**

You must log in directly on the PADS4 server console to access the root user (username: `su\root`). Remote access attempts will result in an error message due to security restrictions.

This design ensures domain setup and critical changes are performed securely on the local machine before delegating to domain-specific administrators.
