Viewer Variables, also known as **Dynamic Filtering**, allow you to create **smart and efficient digital signage content**. Instead of designing multiple presentations for different viewers, you can use Viewer Variables to automatically adapt content based on predefined values.

## **Meeting Room Example**
Imagine managing 50 meeting room door signs in your digital signage network. Each sign displays a unique room number. Traditionally, you would need 50 separate presentations.

With Viewer Variables, you design one presentation and let the system dynamically insert the correct room number for each display.

## **Creating a Viewer Variable**
### **Steps:**
1. Open PADS4 CTRL Center.
2. Go to the **Viewers** menu category.
3. Select **Variables** from the section that opens.
4. Create a new Viewer Variable:
   - Enter a name, for example, **MeetingRoomName**.
   - Click **Create** to add the variable.
5. Now, each **Viewer** can have its own unique value for **MeetingRoomName**.

## **Designing a Presentation with Viewer Variables**
1. Create a text field in PADS4 Designer.
2. Insert the Viewer Variable as **#MeetingRoomName#**.
3. Schedule the presentation to your Viewers.

Each Viewer will display its assigned **Meeting Room Name** without needing separate presentations.

## **Dynamic Content Adaptation**
Viewer Variables are not limited to room numbers. You can use them for:
- Location-based data
- Directional signs
- IP addresses
- Opening hours
- Personalized messages

### **Example: SQL Integration**
If you are fetching data from a database, you can insert Viewer Variables into SQL queries:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Table WHERE [field1] = #MeetingRoomName#
```

This ensures that the query dynamically filters data based on the Viewer Variable.

## **Where Can Viewer Variables Be Used?**
- Text fields in presentations  
- SQL queries in data providers  
- Playlist items for dynamic content rotation  

Viewer Variables **cannot** be used in password fields.

---

## **How Viewer Variables Work**
PADS4 automatically scans all text for Viewer Variables (formatted as `#VariableName#`) and replaces them with the assigned values.

If a **meeting room name** changes, simply update the value in **Viewer Variables**â€”there is no need to modify the presentation.

## **Conclusion**
Viewer Variables simplify content management by allowing dynamic customization across multiple Viewers. This ensures a scalable, efficient, and flexible digital signage system with minimal manual updates.
