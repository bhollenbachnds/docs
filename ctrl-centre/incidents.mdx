Incidents are **automatically created** when a **defined rule** in an **Area** is triggered. These rules monitor **sensor data** and generate alerts when specific conditions are met.

For more details on **setting up sensors and defining rules**, refer to the **How to Use Sensors** page.

### **How Incidents Are Created**
- **Incidents are triggered by rules set in Areas** where sensors are monitoring real-time data.
- A rule is usually based on **a threshold or limit being exceeded** (e.g., **maximum people count, high temperature, or no facemask detected**).
- When a rule condition is met, **PADS4 automatically logs an incident**.
