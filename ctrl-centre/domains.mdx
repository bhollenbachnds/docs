title: "PADS4 Domains"
---

Domains in PADS4 make it possible to manage multiple independent client environments on a single PADS4 server. This allows different organizations or departments to operate separately while using the same infrastructure.

With the enhanced domain support, all PADS4 services and applications are now domain-aware, and domains can be fully configured and managed through the PADS4 CTRL Center.

## **Prerequisites**

<Info>
  Before creating a new domain, ensure that your **PADS4 installation is updated to version 2023.1 **or later, as domain functionality is only supported from this version onward.
</Info>

Each domain requires its own **PADS4 license**. Verify that you have obtained the necessary license before proceeding with domain setup.

## Creating a PADS4 Domain

Follow the steps below to create a new PADS4 domain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to PADS4 as Root">

    - **Username:** `su\root`
    - **Password:** `******` _(Your chosen password)_
