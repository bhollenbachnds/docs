title: "PADS4 Domains"

Domains in PADS4 make it possible to manage multiple independent client environments on a single PADS4 server. This allows different organizations or departments to operate separately while using the same infrastructure.

With the enhanced domain support, all PADS4 services and applications are now domain-aware, and domains can be fully configured and managed through the PADS4 CTRL Center.

## Prerequisites

<Info>
  Before creating a new domain, ensure that your **PADS4 installation is updated to version 2023.1** or later, as domain functionality is only supported from this version onward.
</Info>

Each domain requires its own **PADS4 license**. Verify that you have obtained the necessary license before proceeding with domain setup.

## Default Domain

During PADS4 installation, a default domain named **PADS** is automatically created. This serves as the initial environment.

### Editing the Default Domain

From the Domains section of the root interface:

- Select the **PADS** domain entry.
- Click the **three dots ⁝** menu to access edit options.
- Update the **DNS Host Name** to match your server's address.
- Upload your third-party signed **SSL certificate** (_.CRT_) and **private key** (_.KEY_).
