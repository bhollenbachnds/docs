## **What Are Domains in PADS4?**

Domains in PADS4 allow you to manage **multiple separate client environments** on a **single PADS4 server**. This means different organizations or departments can **operate independently** while sharing the same infrastructure.

With **reworked domain support**, all PADS4 services and applications are now domain-compatible, and domains can be **fully managed in PADS4 CTRL Center**.

## **Prerequisites**

✔ **Request a License for Your Domain**\
Before adding a new domain, contact the **PADS4 Sales Team** at [**sales@pads4.com**](mailto:sales@pads4.com) to request:

- A **server license** for your domain
- Any additional **user or Viewer licenses** needed

✔ **Upgrade to PADS4 2023.1 or Later**\
Domains require PADS4 **2023.1 or higher**. Ensure your system is **updated before proceeding**.

## **Step 1: Creating a Root User**

Before setting up a domain, a **root user** must be configured.

1. **Open** the **PADS4 Foundation Configuration Tool**.
2. **Set a password** for the **root user**.
3. Click **Apply** to create the root user.
4. **Store the password securely**.

---

## **Step 2: Logging into PADS4 CTRL Center as Root**

Now that the **root user** is created, log in with:

- **Username:** `su\root`
- **Password:** `******` _(Your chosen password)_

After logging in, you will see an **empty dashboard**, similar to an Administrator login, but with an **additional Domains tab**.

## **Step 3: Configuring Domains**

You can now **add a new domain** or **modify the existing default domain ("pads")**.

### **Creating a New Domain**

1. Click **\+ New** in the Domains dashboard.
2. **Enter the domain details**:
   - **Custom Domain Name** (e.g., "CompanyA" or "Branch1").
   - **DNS Host Name** – Specify the domain’s **DNS hostname**.
   - **Certificate File** – Upload the **third-party signed SSL certificate** (`.CRT format`).
   - **Private Key File** – Upload the **third-party signed private key** (`.KEY format`).
3. Click **Create**.
   - This will **restart PADS4 services** and apply the domain settings.

---

## **Step 4: Logging Into the New Domain**

Once the domain is created, you can log in using:

- **Username:** `DomainName\user1` (e.g., `Test123\user1`)
- **Password:** `*****`

After logging in, **activate the new domain** using the **Activate PADS4 Server** mechanism at the top of the screen.

---

## **Step 5: Managing Users & Configurations**

Now that your **new domain is active**, you can:

- **Log in to PADS4 System Management** with `user1` credentials.
- **Set up additional users & permissions**.
- **Assign Viewer licenses** for domain-based content management.
