<Warning>
  Since PADS4 version 2025.2, SMTP configuration is done in the PADS4 Web Portal instead of the CMS 1.0 Admin plugin page.
</Warning>

This document provides step-by-step instructions for configuring SMTP with basic authentication for both the PADS4 Web Portal as well as CMS 1.0 / Workspace.

<Tip>
  Our SMTP implementation also supports SMTP with OAuth2 authentication, more information in regards to setting up SMTP with Oauth2 can be found here. [SMTP-Oauth2](https://docs.pads4.com/ctrl-centre/administration/smtp-oauth2/Microsoft)
