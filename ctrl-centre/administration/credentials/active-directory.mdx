PADS4 allows integration with **Active Directory (AD)** to streamline **user authentication and management**. This is accomplished through the **Credentials** interface in **PADS4 CTRL Center**.

Follow the steps below to connect your Active Directory instance:

---

## **1. Accessing the PADS4 CTRL Center**

To begin:

* Open your **web browser**.
* Navigate to the **PADS4 server URL** (either a DNS name or IP address).
* Log in using an **Administrator account**.

Once logged in:

* Click on **Dashboard**.
* Use the **Toggle Sidebar** button at the **top-right** of the screen.
* Navigate to **Credentials**.
* Then select **Providers**.

## **2. Adding an Active Directory Connection**

To add Active Directory:

1. Click **+ New**
2. Select **Identity**
3. Choose **Active Directory**

You’ll be prompted to fill in the required configuration details:

* **Host Name** – The domain name or IP of your AD server.
* **Port** – Typically `389` for LDAP or `636` for LDAPS.
* **Use SSL** – Enable this toggle if you're using **Secure LDAP (LDAPS)**.
* **Username** – An AD account with read permissions (e.g., `admin@domain.local`).
* **Password** – The password associated with the above account.

Once completed, click **Create** to finalize the connection.

## **3. Managing Users via Active Directory**

After successfully connecting:

* You can now **import and manage users** from your Active Directory within PADS4.
