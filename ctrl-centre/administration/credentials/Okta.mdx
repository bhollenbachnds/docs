PADS4 allows integration with **Okta** to streamline **user authentication and management**. This is accomplished through the **Credentials** interface in **PADS4 CTRL Center**.

Follow the steps below to connect your Okta instance:

## **1. Accessing the PADS4 CTRL Center**

To begin:

- Open your **web browser**.
- Navigate to the **PADS4 server URL** (either a DNS name or IP address).
- Log in using an **Administrator account**.

Once logged in:

- Click on **Dashboard**.
- Use the **Toggle Sidebar** button at the **top-right** of the screen.
- Navigate to **Credentials**.
- Then select **Providers**.

## **2. Create the Okta application**

To configure an Okta identity provider, you will need to connect to Okta as an Administrator and create a new okta app integration.

- On Okta, go to Applications page
- Click on “Create App Integration”

![Okta App4](/images/ctrl-centre/administration/credentials/Okta-app4.png)

<Note>
  Make sure the values "Single sign-on URL" and "Audience URI (SP Entity ID)" have the structure as described below or the configuration will not work.
</Note>

- Single sign-on URL:
  - local pads4 url with **/rdx/**[**nds.services**](http://nds.services)**.authentication.integration/api/v1/pads/Saml2/Acs**
  - For example: https://pads4.mycompany.com/rdx/nds.services.authentication.integration/api/v1/pads/Saml2/Acs
- Audience URI (SP Entity ID):
  - local pads4 url with **/saml** 
  - For example: https://pads4.mycompany.com/saml

<Warning>
  If the domain of your pads4 instance is different than “pads”, you must update the domain with your own domain name. (e.g : for a domain named “domaineone”, the url will be https://pads4.mycompany.com/rdx/nds.services.authentication.integration/api/v1/domainone/Saml2/Acs

  Your configured domain name can be verified by logging in with your su\\root account and go to the "Domains" section:

  ![Domain Config](/images/ctrl-centre/administration/credentials/Domain-config.png)
</Warning>

## **4. Attributes & claims**

- Edit the attributes and claims to match the values below

| Name                                                               | Name format | Value          |

| Metadata URL        | https://myokta.okta.com/app/xxxxxxxxxxxx/sso/saml/metadata |
| Sign on URL         | https://myokta.okta.com/app/xxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxx/sso/saml  |
| Issuer              | https://www.okta.com/xxxxxxxx                              |
| Signing certificate | okta.cert                                                  |

## **7. Configuring the provider in PADS4**

![Okta Provider Details](/images/ctrl-centre/administration/credentials/okta-provider-details.png)

Fill in the information as follows:

- Name: Represent the name of your provider in PADS4 (can be any value)
- Indentifier: Represent the "**Issuer**" value collected in step 6.
- Reply URL: Represent your local pads4 FQDN
  - Example: [**https://pads4.mycompany.com**](https://pads4.mycompany.com)
- Metadata URL: Represent the "**Metadata URL**" collected in step 6
- **Indentifier** and **Assertion Consumer Service URL** will be filled in automatically.

Now go to step 2 to upload the certificates required:

![Okta Certificate](/images/ctrl-centre/administration/credentials/okta-certificate.png)

- **Provider signing certificate**: Upload the Okta signing certificate retrieved in step 6.
- **Certificate from/for "domainone"**: Upload any certificate (.PFX) you want to sign assertions from PADS4 to the external identity provider.
- **Private key password**: Fill in the password that relates to the PFX certificate used above.
