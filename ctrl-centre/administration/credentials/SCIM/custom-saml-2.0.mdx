<Warning>
  This article requires you to have at least PADS4 version 2025.2.
</Warning>

For any identity provider that supports user provisioning feature with SCIM standard, you can apply the following configuration :

- SCIM URL – Here you will need to fill in the url that was given on the PADS4 identity provider as “SCIM URL” (e.g. https://pads4.mycompany.com /rdx/[nds.services](http://nds.services).user.scim/api/v1/scim)
- SCIM Token – The SCIM authentication used on PADS4 is using a Bearer token authentication, so here you will need to fill in the token that was given on the PADS4 identity provider as “SCIM Access token”

<Warning>
  Attention: This SCIM URL must be publicly accessible because the identity provider uses it as a callback for user provisioning.
</Warning>

Please ensure that your SCIM Configuration does push notifications for any create/update/delete users, and same for the user groups.

Then regarding the user & group property mapping, please fill in at least those required properties:

- userName
- familyName
- givenName
- preferredLanguage
- emails
