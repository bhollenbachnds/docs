In our latest release, 2025.1, we are introducing our new user management system.

This fundamental change moves the User Management settings from the System Management application to the PADS4 Web Portal.

With this change, we have also introduced Roles to further refine the user management part of PADS4.

Roles will allow you to quickly assign a certain set of licenses and permissions to a user.

<Warning>
  The new user management system is not compatible with Legacy CMS and Workspace in PADS4 version 2025.1,**this has been added in PADS4 version 2025.2.** 
</Warning>

## How to use roles in PADS4

<Info>
  The System Management and License Management licenses are required to administer your users and roles
</Info>

- You can access it by logging in to your PADS4 Web Portal with your Adminstrator account. Go to Dashboard, and on the bottom left go to **Users**.
