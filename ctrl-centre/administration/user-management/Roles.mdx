title: "Users and Roles"
---

In our latest release, 2025.1, we are introducing our new user management system.

This fundamental change moves the User Management settings from the System Management application to the PADS4 Web Portal.

With this change, we have also introduced Roles to further refine the user management part of PADS4.

Roles will allow you to quickly assign a certain set of licenses and permissions to a user.

<Warning>
  The new user management system is not compatible with Legacy CMS and Workspace in PADS4 version 2025.1,this has been added in PADS4 version 2025.2**.**
</Warning>

## How to use roles in PADS4

<Info>
  The System Management and License Management licenses are required to administer your users and roles
</Info>

- You can access it by logging in to your PADS4 Web Portal with your Adminstrator account. Go to Dashboard, and on the bottom left go to **Users**.

### Search for Users

Use the search function to quickly locate specific users in the system. It searches across key fields: Name, Username, Roles, and License. This is ideal for admins managing PADS4.

**How to Search**

1. Enter keywords in the search box (e.g., "john.doe", "admin role", or "Cms users group").
2. Results filter dynamically as you type—no need to hit Enter.

**Export Results**

Click the **Export** button to download results as Excel. This expands the view for bulk analysis or reporting. Exported data includes all visible columns for easy import elsewhere.

## Default roles

<Note>
  In PADS4 version 2025.1 there are five default roles, since PADS4 version 2025.2, five additionel roles have been added which are listed further in the article.
