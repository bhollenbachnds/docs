A **Cluster** is a combination of **two or more Viewers** that work together to display content as a unified area. This is particularly useful when information cannot fit on a single display, ensuring a **seamless visual experience**.

Clusters are widely used in environments such as **airports**, **fast food restaurants**, and **large menu boards**, where information must be displayed dynamically across multiple screens.

---

## **How Clusters Work**
### **Example: A Horizontal 3-Viewer Cluster**
Imagine a cluster of **three horizontally aligned Viewers**. This setup is commonly seen in:
- **Airports** (Flight Information Displays)
- **Fast food chains** (Digital menu boards)

If **Viewer 2 fails**, the system can automatically instruct **Viewer 3 to take over its content**, preventing any gaps in the displayed information.

#### **Example Use Cases**
- **Airports:**  
  - The flight that **departs first** gets **higher priority** on the display.
  - If a Viewer fails, the system **reorganizes the content** dynamically, ensuring that the most **time-sensitive flights remain visible**.

- **Fast Food Restaurants:**  
  - In the **morning**, Viewer 2 might display **coffee specials**.
  - During **lunch**, it could switch to **meal deals**.
  - If **Viewer 2 fails**, an automated system could:
    - Show both coffee and lunch items on Viewer 3.
    - Introduce a **carousel effect**, alternating between breakfast and lunch menus.

By defining **rules** in PADS4, the system can **automatically react to hardware failures**, ensuring continuous and logical content display.

### **Example: A Multi-Row Cluster (3x2 Configuration)**
Clusters are **not limited to horizontal layouts**. In this example:
- Three **horizontal Viewers** in two **stacked rows**.
- **Rows can be configured differently** (e.g., Viewer 2 can be positioned **below** Viewer 1).
- **Automated rules** can:
  - **Add headers to the first row** and **remove them from the second row**.
  - Adjust content positioning dynamically when information moves between Viewers.

---

## **Benefits of Using Clusters**
### **1. Simplified Management**
- Instead of **managing multiple Viewers separately**, clusters allow for **centralized management**.
- **Cluster-level problem detection** simplifies troubleshooting.

### **2. Automated Content Prioritization**
- If a **Viewer fails**, content **automatically adjusts** based on priority.
- **Critical information** remains visible at all times.

### **3. Seamless Content Display**
- Even when **hardware fails**, clusters prevent **gaps in information**.
- The system **automatically reorganizes content** to maintain a **logical flow**.

### **4. Rule-Based Automation**
- Clusters can react **automatically** to specific conditions.
- Example: If a screen fails, content can **shift**, **resize**, or **reformat** without manual intervention.

### **5. Flexible Layouts**
- **Supports both horizontal and vertical configurations**.
- Content can **change dynamically based on position** (e.g., different headers in different rows).

### **6. Unlimited Cluster Size**
- No **restrictions on the number of Viewers** in a cluster.
- Scalable for **large installations** (airports, control centers, etc.).

## **Conclusion**
Clusters in **PADS4** offer **flexibility, automation, and reliability** for digital signage networks. By grouping Viewers together, organizations can **optimize content display**, **automate responses to hardware failures**, and **ensure uninterrupted information delivery**â€”all while reducing manual intervention.

Whether used in an **airport**, **restaurant**, or **corporate setting**, **Clusters** provide a **powerful solution** for managing **multi-screen content seamlessly**.
