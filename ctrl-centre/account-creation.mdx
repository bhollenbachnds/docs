  From PADS4 version 2025.1 and onwards, the users and (most) permissions have moved to the PADS4 Web Portal. Where it was previously required that you have the System Management application installed, you are now able to do your user management administration from your web browser.

The user and roles section in PADS4 allows you to create user accounts with the ability to define exactly the access that they require.

## **How to create a user**

1. Log in to the PADS4 Web Portal by browsing to the location your PADS4 server is located / hosted: http(s)://servername:portnumber
   - HTTPS is used in secured environments, otherwise use http.
   - Servername specifies on which server PADS4 CTRL Center is installed.
   - Portnumber is optional when hosted on port 80

  Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are only supported
