title: "Viewer Permissions"

<Warning>
  This article applies to PADS4 version 2025.2 and above.

  All versions before that have the viewer permission administration in the PADS4 System Management application.
</Warning>

The **Viewer permissions** in **PADS4** allows you to have granular control over which **viewer group (s) ** and **viewer(s)** are visible for each specific user. This way you can precisly configure what an end user is able to see and control.

## **Default Viewer Permissions**

Viewer permissions work simarly as the content permissions in the PADS4 Web Portal, on each viewer group or viewer you can right click and a context menu will pop-up with the ability to open the **"Access"** menu.

- In the Detail view of the viewers:

- In the Treeview view of the viewers:

![Treeview Perm](/images/ctrl-centre/viewers/treeview-perm.png)

Once you open the **Access** menu you get an overview of the current permissions that are currently on that viewer group or viewer.

## How to set up permissions

If you want to restrict a certain viewer group ( or viewer ) it is advised to do it as follows:

Login with your administrator account and go to the **Users** section.

- [Create a new role](https://docs.pads4.com/ctrl-centre/administration/user-management/Roles#customizing-roles)
- Assign your newly created role to the user that requires viewer restrictions.
- Remove any of the default viewer roles if assigned.
- Now go to the Viewers overview and right click on a viewer group / viewer you want the user to be able to see.


- Click on **Access**
- Now add your newly created role to the list and give it at least the **read** permission so it can see the viewer group / viewer.
  - Add more permissions if required.
- Now if the user which has the new role assigned logs in, he will only see the viewer group / viewer where his role is assigned.

<Info>
  When you have multiple roles assigned which have different permissions, remember that the most restrictive role always overrules any other role that you might have assigned.
