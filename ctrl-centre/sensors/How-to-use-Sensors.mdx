PADS4 allows you to integrate **cameras, camera management software, and other sensor devices** to collect and process real-time data. These sensors provide **audience measurement**, **facial recognition**, **people counting**, and **environmental monitoring** capabilities.

For a list of **certified sensors**, check the **Certified Sensors Page**.

## **Overview**
The **Sensors Overview** section displays all added sensors. A **green dot** indicates that PADS4 has an **active connection** to the sensor.

### **Adding a New Sensor**
To add a new sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the Sensors Overview Page** in PADS4.
2. **Click the "New" button** in the header.
3. **Select the Sensor Type** – Camera or Sensor Management Software.
4. **Specify the Model/Type** of the device.
5. **Optionally Add a Description & Location** to help identify the sensor.
6. **Enter the Credentials and Hostname** where the sensor is located.
7. **Save the Configuration** – PADS4 will attempt to establish a connection.

## **Grouping Sensors into Areas**
An **Area** is a logical grouping of sensors. This allows for **aggregated data collection and analysis**.

### **People Counting**
- If multiple **people-counting cameras** are in an Area, their data is **combined**.
- Useful for **tracking total occupancy** when there are multiple entry points.

### **Creating a New Area**
1. **Go to the Areas Page** in PADS4.
2. **Click "New"** in the header.
3. **Enter an Area Name** and (optional) description.
4. **Select Sensors** that belong to this area.
5. **Assign Rules** to automate incident detection.
6. **Save the Configuration**.

## **Defining Incident Rules**
Rules define **what conditions trigger an incident**, allowing automated responses.

### **Available Rules**
| **Rule** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------|
| **No Facemask** | Detects if a person is **not wearing a facemask** and triggers an incident. |
| **Maximum People Count** | Sets a **maximum occupancy** for an area. If exceeded, an incident is created. |
| **Maximum Temperature** | Monitors body temperature. If **exceeding a set threshold** (e.g., 36.5°C), an incident is triggered. |
| **Milestone Alarms** | Uses **Milestone VMS** alarms to detect security or safety concerns. Alarms can trigger incidents. |

> **Note:** The temperature setting must match the camera’s configured unit (**Celsius or Fahrenheit**).

## **Managing Incidents**
Incidents are generated when **rules are triggered**. You can manage incidents in the **PADS4 CTRL Center**.

For more details, see the **How to Use Incidents Page**.

## **Using Sensor Data in PADS4 Designer**
PADS4 Designer allows you to integrate **sensor data** into presentations.

### **Data Usage Options**
- **Real-time camera events** for interactive presentations.
- **Aggregated area data** for audience analytics.
- **Incident alerts** displayed on signage for immediate response.
