## Introduction

A **PADS4 Gateway Proxy** allows you to connect gateways from your local server to your PADS4 server on another (physical) location. Some device gateways or (PADS4) servers can only connect with third-party gateways when they are on the same local network due to (usually security) reasons. You can install a PADS4 Gateway Proxy on a Windows server/device to locally connect the gateway with and then connect your PADS4 server with the proxy to allow communication with those devices through the PADS4 server and the proxy.

An example is a SaaS server; the server is not connected to the same LAN as a device hub (e.g. Philips Hue Hub), and the device hub does not allow connections outside of the LAN network. Then, you'll need to install the PADS4 Gateway Proxy on a server/computer on the same LAN as the device hub is to connect with it and add this proxy as a gateway on the domain of the SaaS server.

### Setup a gateway proxy

<Warning>
  A proxy gateway cannot and should not be installed on the same server as the PADS4 server as this defeats the entire purpose of a proxy.
</Warning>

- Download our latest Device Gateway here: [PADS4-Device-Gateway](https://github.com/PADS4/PADS4-Device-Gateway/releases)
- Execute `NDS.PackageManager.Setup.msi` from the **Prerequisites** folder. You need this manager to install the proxy later.

- After installation, double-click (execute) ` nds.device.gateway.ndspx` to install the proxy. The `NDS.Web.Launcher.DeviceProxy.ndspx` is installed automatically when installing the gateway package.

- Then, on the same device as where you installed the proxy, open a browser and visit http://localhost:8692/launcher. Fill in the details of your PADS4 Server to connect with. In **Client ID**, enter any name you want as long as it's unique to your other proxies – in case you have more than one.

- Click `Install`. It will start setting up the proxy. The following screenshot indicates a successful setup.

- Now in your PADS4 Web Portal you will see a gateway including the name you have set on the proxy.

- You can now use this proxy when required while adding a gateway:
