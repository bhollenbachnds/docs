Welcome to the **PADS4 API Documentation**, your complete reference for interacting programmatically with the PADS4 Platform.

The PADS4 API suite is built to support seamless integration, automation, and scalability of your digital signage and workspace solutions. Whether you're building a custom frontend, integrating with third-party systems, or automating content workflows, this API documentation provides all the tools and endpoints needed to communicate with the PADS4 backend services.

Each API module is designed around a specific domain of functionality within the PADS4 ecosystem. All services follow a RESTful architecture and expose OpenAPI (Swagger) definitions to streamline development and reduce integration effort.

Each group has a dedicated Swagger interface, available via OpenAPI links, allowing developers to explore endpoints, test requests, and build integrations confidently.

To begin, choose a group relevant to your integration needs and consult its Swagger documentation. All APIs are secured, and proper authentication is required to make calls to most endpoints.
