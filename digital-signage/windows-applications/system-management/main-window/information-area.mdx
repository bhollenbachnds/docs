After you have selected an information category in the navigation pane, the information will be retrieved, and the results will be displayed in a window in the **information area**. The way the results are displayed in the information window depends on the chosen category.

For most categories, a number of context-sensitive functions will become available in the ribbon bar. The same context-sensitive functions can also be called by right-clicking the information window.

By default, the PADS4 application uses one information window per information category. This means that when you switch to another information category, another window will be opened to display the results. If you switch to an information category that already has an opened window this window will become active and reused to display the results. When you work with multiple servers, the system will use one information window per information category per server connection. Optionally, you can manually open additional information windows as described in **Working with multiple windows**.

#### Refreshing data

The information in the information window always reflects the actual situation and is automatically refreshed. For this reason, there is no function to manually refresh the information.
