From the **destinations window,** you can define new viewer groups, viewers, zone viewers, HTML viewers and desktop viewers.

A viewer group is a logical unit that consists of other destinations. The members of a group can be viewers or other groups. Groups can be nested without any limitations and viewers or groups can be a member of an unlimited number of groups.

Groups are typically used to organize your destinations in a logical structure and to control them group-wise instead of per individual viewer.
