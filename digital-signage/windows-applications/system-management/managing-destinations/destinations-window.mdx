**License**\
The license that has been assigned to this viewer. Viewers can only be used when they have a valid license. Licenses can be manually assigned by **editing a destination** or as has been described in managing licenses. Viewer groups never require a license.

<Note>
  For PADS4 Desktop Viewers you cannot assign a license. PADS4 Desktop Viewers work with concurrent licenses, which means that the application will claim a license when it connects and releases the license again when it disconnects.
</Note>

**License Type** \

| **Status**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| No license         | The viewer does not have a license assigned. As a result the viewer application will not correctly. You can manually assign a license by **editing the destination** or as has been described in managing licenses.                                                                                                                                           |
| License assigned   | The viewer does have a license assigned, but the license has not been activated yet. When the viewer application successfully connects to PADS4 Server it will automatically activate the assigned license and thus link the license to the hardware of the Viewer PC. When the hardware of the Viewer PC changes, you have to manually reassign the license. |
| Licenses activated | The viewer has a license and the assigned license has been successfully activated. As long as the hardware of the Viewer PC will not change, the viewer application will work with the assigned license.                                                                                                                                                      |
