When PADS4 System Management has been started, it will look for available PADS4 Server connections. Depending on how you have set up your connection properties, the application will either connect and log on to your PADS4 Server automatically, or you will have to do this manually.

<Tip>
  Optionally, you can work with multiple PADS4 Server connections. For more information about this, see [Connecting to multiple servers](/digital-signage/windows-applications/agent/advanced-features/connecting-to-multiple-servers).

#### **To connect to your PADS4 Server for the first time**

When it's the very first time you start PADS4 System Management and you haven't set any connection properties yet, you will get the following message:

#### **Connecting to your PADS4 Server**

If you have specified in your connection properties to automatically connect to your PADS4 Server, PADS4 System Management will automatically try to establish a connection once it has been started. In all other situations, you will have to establish a connection manually:

1. Click the bottom part of the **Connect** button on the **Home** tab of the ribbon bar.

#### **Disconnecting from your PADS4 Server**

To disconnect from your PADS4 Server again, click **Disconnect** on the **Home** tab of the ribbon bar.

 

#### **Reconnecting to your PADS4 Server**
