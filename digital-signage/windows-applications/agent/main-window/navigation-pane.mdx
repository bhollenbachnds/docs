#### **Black boxes**

Each PADS4 Viewer automatically creates a so-called black box in which valuable information about PADS4 is stored. This includes system information and various logs. When you encounter a problem with a PADS4 Viewer, the black box is the ideal source of information to analyze the situation and trace the problem. So, when you contact support for a problem with a PADS4 Viewer it's suggested always to send the black box file.

With the navigation pane you can add black box files to your system and view the stored information.

 

#### **To add a black box file to the application**

1. Click on the **Black box** tab in the navigation pane.

   ![EN Agent Navigationpane Blackbox Pn](/images/digital-signage/windows-applications/agent/main-window/EN-Agent-Navigationpane-Blackbox.png)
2. Click the **Add** toolbar button in the navigation pane.

   ![EN Agent Navigationpane Blackbox Add Pn](/images/digital-signage/windows-applications/agent/main-window/EN-Agent-Navigationpane-Blackbox-Add.png)
3. In the file open dialog box, select the black box file to add and click **Open**.

After you have added a black box file, you can use the PADS4 Agent application to view the information that is stored in the black box file.

Black boxes that you have added keep exist in your PADS4 Agent application, even after closing the application. So, next time when you start the PADS4 Agent application on the same computer you can simply reuse the black boxes that you have previously added. To remove a black box from your PADS4 Agent application you need to manually remove it as described below.

   ![EN Agent Navigationpane Blackbox Category Pn](/images/digital-signage/windows-applications/agent/main-window/EN-Agent-Navigationpane-Blackbox-Category.png)

After this the system will automatically open the black box file to retrieve the requested information and display the results in the [information area](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Main%20Window/Information%20area.htm) of the main window.
