With the User connection functions you can remotely check for all Users in the PADS4 System which applications they are logged into and optionally force a close connection on one or all applications.

 

#### **To check the connection status of your PADS4 Users**

1. Click on the **Server** tab in the navigation pane.

2. Click **User Connections** in the list of available server information categories.

After this the system will automatically retrieve the requested information from the connected PADS4 Server and display the results in the user connections window. If your PADS4 installation includes sub servers then the user connections window will always show the global results of your entire PADS4 installation, no matter what server you have selected.

 

#### **User connections window**

In the user connections window you can see at a glance which User is logged into which PADS4 application and for how long.
