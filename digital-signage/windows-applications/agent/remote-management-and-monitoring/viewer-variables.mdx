This allows you to set the value to more than one viewer at the same time.

 

**Export**\
Export all viewer variables to Microsoft Excel. When you want to duplicate viewer variables to another PADS4 system, or when you want to edit viewer variable values in Excel, which allows more advanced copy/paste actions, the export creates an Excel sheet with all viewer variables. Only cells that are editable are unlocked.

 

**Import**\
Import viewer variables from Microsoft Excel.

During import, a Preview window is displayed showing the results after import. There are two options for import. One is a replace where all viewer variables are replaced, and a merge where existing viewer variables are updated, and new viewer variables are added.

- It is possible to import new viewer variables in the Excel document
- It is not possible to import new viewer names in the Excel document
- Cells that are not editable are locked
- Make use of the Excel document template from export
- Excel documents that do not match the template will be ignored

  Adding/Removing Viewer variables is performed with the PADS4 System Management application.
