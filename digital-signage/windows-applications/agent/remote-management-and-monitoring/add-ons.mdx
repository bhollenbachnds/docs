With the Add-On functions, you can retrieve information about the installed Add-Ons on your PADS4 Viewer and to install additional Add-Ons. Add-ons are custom-developed page elements that can be used in PADS4 presentations. To be able to use an Add-On, it must be installed on each PADS4 Viewer PC for playback of the presentation.
