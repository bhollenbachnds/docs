With the fonts functions, you can retrieve information about the installed fonts on your PADS4 Viewer. When you use certain fonts in your PADS4 presentations, these fonts need to be installed on a PADS4 Viewer for correct playback of your presentation.

 

#### **To retrieve information about the installed fonts on a PADS4 Viewer**

1. Click on the **Viewer** tab in the navigation pane.

2. Select a Viewer from the list of available destinations.
3. Click **Fonts** in the list of available viewer information categories.

After this, the system will automatically connect to the connected PADS4 Server to retrieve the requested information from the selected Viewer and display the results in the fonts window.

<Warning>
  The PADS4 application will only be able to start retrieving the requested viewer information when you have selected <u>both</u> a Viewer and a Category in the navigation pane.
