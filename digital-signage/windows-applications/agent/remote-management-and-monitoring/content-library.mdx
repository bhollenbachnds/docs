#### **Content library window**

The content library window shows the content of the PADS4 content library on your server or viewer and enables you to browse it on a read-only basis. This information is intended especially to check if the content of your content library is correct and if all content library files have been synchronized.

<Tip>
  At the bottom of the content library window you can see the number of files, number of folders and the total size of your content library files. By comparing this information of two content libraries you can quickly get an indication if both content libraries are identical.
