With the synchronization log functions, you can view the log messages of the content synchronization process on your PADS4 Viewer or the log messages stored in a black box file. The synchronization log of a PADS4 Viewer can be cleared or saved to a file, together with other black box information.

 

#### **To view the synchronization log of a PADS4 Viewer**

1. Click on the **Viewer** tab in the navigation pane.

2. Select a Viewer from the list of available destinations.
3. Click **Synchronization log** in the list of available viewer information categories.

After this, the system will automatically connect to the connected PADS4 Server to retrieve the requested information from the selected Viewer and display the results in the synchronization log window.

<Warning>
  The PADS4 application will only be able to start retrieving the requested viewer information when you have selected <u>both</u> a Viewer and a Category in the navigation pane.
</Warning>

 

#### **To view the synchronization log of a black box file**

1. Make sure the black box has been [added](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Main%20Window/Navigation%20pane.htm) to the application.
2. Click on the **Black Box** tab in the navigation pane.

3. Select the black box item in the list of available black boxes.
4. Click **Synchronization log** in the list of available black box information categories.

After this, the system will automatically open the black box file to retrieve the requested information and display the results in the synchronization log window.

 

#### **Synchronization log window**

The synchronization log window shows all log messages that have been generated by the content synchronization process on a Viewer PC. With this information, you can check when the synchronization process has run and get details about the items being synchronized.

![EN Agent Synchronizationlog Pn](/images/digital-signage/windows-applications/agent/remote-management-and-monitoring/EN-Agent-Synchronizationlog.png)

**Time Stamp**\
Date and time at which the item was logged.

**Message**\
The actual item that has been logged. Usually, each synchronization session starts with the message 'Requesting new synchronization session' and ends with 'Synchronization session finished'.

**Size**\
If the synchronization process adds new items to your content library, then here the size of the added file is listed.

 

#### **Clearing the synchronization log**

By clearing the synchronization log, you can restart the logging process of your PADS4 Viewer. To clear the synchronization log:

1. Click **Clear Log** on the **Home** menu.

2. Click **Yes** to confirm that you want to clear the synchronization log.

After this, all log messages will be removed from the synchronization log on the PADS4 Viewer PC.

 

#### **Saving the synchronization log**

To save the synchronization log for viewing it offline at a later moment, you can save it together with other [black box](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Main%20Window/Navigation%20pane.htm) information of your Viewer. To save the synchronization log:

1. Click **Save Black Box** on the **Home** menu.
2. Enter a **File name** and click **Save** to save the information.

After this, the black box file will be saved on your computer.

<Tip>
  Each PADS4 Viewer automatically creates a so-called black box in which valuable information about PADS4 is stored. This includes system information and various logs. When you encounter a problem with a PADS4 Viewer, the black box is the ideal source of information to analyze the situation and trace the problem. So, when you contact support for a problem with a PADS4 Viewer it's suggested always to send the black box file.
