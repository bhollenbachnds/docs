With the server functions of PADS4 Agent, you can retrieve all kinds of information from your connected PADS4 Server and remotely make adjustments.

To get access to the server functions, you must [select a server information category](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Main%20Window/Navigation%20pane.htm) in the navigation pane of the main window. If you have a PADS4 installation that besides a main server also includes sub servers, then you must follow the procedure as has been described in [working with sub servers](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Advanced%20features/Working%20with%20sub%20servers.htm).
