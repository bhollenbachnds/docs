With the screenshot functions you can retrieve a screenshot of the actual situation on your PADS4 Viewer. The built-in zoom functions enable you view detailed aspects of screenshots.

 

#### **To retrieve the screenshot of a PADS4 Viewer**

1. Click on the **Viewer** tab in the navigation pane.

2. Select a Viewer from the list of available destinations.
3. Click **Screenshot** in the list of available viewer information categories.

After this the system will automatically connect to the connected PADS4 Server to retrieve the requested information from the selected Viewer and display the results in the screenshot window.

<Warning>
  The PADS4 application will only be able to start retrieving the requested viewer information when you have selected <u>both</u> a Viewer and a Category in the navigation pane.
</Warning>

 

#### **Screenshot window**

The screenshot window shows a snapshot of the situation on your PADS4 Viewer PC when the screenshot was being taken. This enables you to quickly check the actual situation of your PADS4 Viewer.

<Tip>
  Screenshots are always taken at real size. Although the information is compressed when sent over the network retrieving a screenshot may lead to an increase of the network traffic. On low bandwidth networks it may take a significant amount of time to retrieve a screenshot.
</Tip>

When the status of your PADS4 Viewer is 'connected' then the screenshot window will show a screenshot of the PADS4 Viewer window. If the PADS4 Viewer is disconnected, but your PADS4 Controller is still connected then a screenshot of the entire Windows desktop will be returned instead.

 

#### **Zooming**

Several zoom functions enable you to view the screenshot at your own preferred zoom level. Because screenshots are always retrieved at real size you can zoom into every detail you like.

The available zoom functions can be accessed via the ribbon bar of the application or you can use the zoom control that is displayed on top of the screenshot window.
