#### **Viewer log window**

The viewer log window shows all log messages that have been generated by either the PADS4 Viewer application or PADS4 Controller. When you face a problem with a PADS4 Viewer, then the Viewer log is usually the starting point for finding the cause of your problem.

Optionally, you can use the toggle buttons at the bottom of the viewer log window to filter the displayed messages. For instance, when you only want to see warnings and error messages.\
The button below on the right copies the selected item to the **clipboard**. Another way is to use the right mouse button above the item and select copy to clipboard from the menu.

**Level**\
An icon to indicate if the logged item is an information message, warning, or error.

**Time Stamp**\

**Source**\
Name of the process that logged the item. If the process is PADS4 Viewer, the viewer name that identifies the PADS4 Viewer is listed.

**Message**\

#### **Saving the (HTML5) Viewer log**

To save the Viewer log for viewing it offline at a later moment, you can save it together with other [black box](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Main%20Window/Navigation%20pane.htm) information of your Viewer. To save the viewer log:

1. Click **Save Black Box** on the **Home** menu.
2. Enter a **File name** and click **Save** to save the information.

After this, the black box file will be saved on your computer.

<Tip>
  Each PADS4 Viewer automatically creates a so-called black box in which valuable information about PADS4 is stored. This includes system information and various logs. When you encounter a problem with a PADS4 (HTML5) Viewer, the black box is the ideal source of information to analyze the situation and trace the problem. So, when you contact support for a problem with a PADS4 (HTML5) Viewer it's suggested always to send the black box file.
