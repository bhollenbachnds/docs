## **Connecting to your PADS4 Server**

When PADS4 Agent has been started, it will look for available PADS4 Server connections. Depending on how you have set up your connection properties, the application will either connect and logon to your PADS4 Server automatically or you have to do this manually.

<Note>
  Optionally, you can work with multiple PADS4 Server connections. For more information about this, see [Connecting to multiple servers](https://pads4documentation.blob.core.windows.net/agent/Content/Advanced%20features/Connecting%20to%20multiple%20servers.htm).
