In the monitoring & alerts window of your PADS4 server all alerts of both your server and all its viewers are displayed. In the monitoring & alerts window of a PADS4 Viewer only the alerts that are applicable to this viewer are shown.

**Name**\
The descriptive name which has been entered when creating the alert.

**Description**\
System-defined description of the defined alert.

**Enabled**\
Shows if the item is currently monitored (enabled) or if the monitoring process has been temporarily switched off (disabled).

**Notify Users**\
Shows the users that will be notified when an alert is raised.

**Alerts**\
Shows if there are any unresolved alerts related to the monitored item.

**Destinations**\
Shows all destinations that are monitored by the defined alert.

 

#### **Alerts**

If you select an alert definition in the top pane of the monitoring & alerts window that has generated at least one alert, then the **Alerts** show details about the generated alert.

**Time Stamp**\
The date and time of the moment that the alert was generated.

**Destination**\
The destination where the alert was generated. This can be the server of your system or a viewer.

**Status**\
Indicates if the alert is pending (which means waiting for a solution) or resolved. If a problem is automatically resolved by the system itself, then all generated alerts for this problem will get the status 'resolved'. It's also possible to manually change the status of a generated alert.

**Message**\
Shows information about the generated alert.\
If the message is 'See details' then you can click the Details button to check the details of the generated alert. The ways the details are shown depends on the kind of alert.\

<Tip>
  By default, generated alerts are automatically removed after 4 weeks. This option can be adjusted by changing the server settings of your PADS4 installation via the PADS4 System Management application.
