#### **Arranging your windows**

After you have opened multiple windows, you can optionally arrange your windows in horizontal or vertical tab groups. Tab groups enable you to view your windows side by side.

<Tip>
  Having multiple windows opened side by side is very useful when you want to compare information between PADS4 Servers or Viewers.

  The functions for arranging your information windows can also be called by right-clicking the tab area of an information window and clicking one of the context menu items.

  To close all windows except the one you are working on, right-click the tab area of your current window and select **Close All But This** from the context menu.
