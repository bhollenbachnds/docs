## **Tip**
- If you want to **temporarily exclude** a page without deleting it, **disable the Visibility property** of the page. This will prevent it from showing during playback without permanently removing it.

## **Remarks**
- **The last page** of a presentation **cannot be removed** to ensure the presentation always contains at least one page.
- If the **Thumbnails window** is active, you can also press the **[Del] key** on your keyboard to remove the selected page.
