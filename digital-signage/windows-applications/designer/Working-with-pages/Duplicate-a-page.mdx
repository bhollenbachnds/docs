Duplicating a page is useful when you want to **reuse the layout or content** of an existing page as a starting point for a new one. This can **save time** and ensure consistency.

## **To Create an Exact Copy of the Current Page**

1. Go to the **Page** menu.
2. Click **Duplicate Page**.

### Option 2: Using the Thumbnails Window

## **Remarks**
- **Duplicated pages** will automatically receive a name based on the **original page name**, with an added suffix (e.g., "Page1 (Copy)").
- The **copied page** is always inserted **directly after the original page** in the presentation.
