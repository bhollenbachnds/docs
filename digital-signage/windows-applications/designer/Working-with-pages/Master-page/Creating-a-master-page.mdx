If your presentation does not yet contain a master page, you can add one. A master page allows you to define a **single background layout** that will be applied automatically to all pages in your presentation where the master page is enabled. This helps ensure a consistent design across multiple pages and simplifies maintenance.

## How to Add a Master Page to Your Presentation

1. Go to the **Page menu**.  
2. In the **Insert section**, select **Master Page**.  

The application will **automatically switch to the master page**, allowing you to start designing it immediately. You can verify that you are working on the master page by checking the **status bar** at the bottom left of the application window.  

Once you are done designing your master page, you can **return to normal pages** using the navigation options under the **View menu** in the **Go To section**.

## Designing Your Master Page

When working on a master page, you have **full design functionality**, just like when designing a regular page. This means you can:
- Add **any type of page element** (e.g., text, images, video, web content).
- Use **data providers** to include real-time data (e.g., clocks, news feeds).

## Important Notes

- **Master page elements remain active and visible** during playback, even when switching between normal pages. For example, if you add a video or scrolling ticker to your master page, it will continue playing as users navigate between pages.
- When you add a master page, it is **automatically applied to all existing pages** in your presentation.
- If you **do not want** the master page shown on specific pages, go to those page's **Style properties** and **disable** the "Show the Master Page on the Background of this Page" option.

## Tip

If you have **multiple pages sharing the same layout**, it is recommended to use a master page. This way, you only need to **maintain and update the layout once**, in a central place, rather than on each individual page. This improves consistency and efficiency in managing your presentation design.
