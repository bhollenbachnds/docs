Instead of creating a master page from scratch, you can **import an existing page** from another presentation and designate it as your master page. This saves time and ensures design consistency if you already have a pre-built layout.

## How to Import a Master Page from Another Presentation

1. Go to the **Page menu**.  
2. Select **Import Master Page** to start the **Import Master Page Wizard**.

### Step 1: Select the Presentation to Import From

- Choose **Content Library** to import a presentation stored in the PADS4 Content Library.  
- Choose **File Name** to import a presentation from another location on your system.  
- Specify the full path to the file, or use the **browse** option to locate it.  
- Click **Next** to continue.

### Step 2: Select the Page to Import as Master Page

- Click on the thumbnail of the page you want to use as the master page.  
- You can select **any page** from the chosen presentation.  
- If the selected page is **not already a master page**, it will be **automatically converted** into a master page upon import.  
- Click **Next** to continue.

## Important Notes

- **Overwriting existing master page**:  
  If your current presentation **already contains a master page**, **it will be replaced** by the imported master page.
  
- **Data Providers**:  
  If the imported page **uses data providers**, these will also be **imported into your presentation** to ensure all linked content and data function correctly.
