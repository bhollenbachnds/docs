A **master page** is used to create a consistent layout throughout your entire presentation. By adding a master page, you can define a page layout that will be shown as a background for all other pages where the master page is enabled.

When using a master page, **it will remain active and visible during playback**, even when switching between normal pages. This means that if your master page contains dynamic content such as videos or scrolling text, these will **continue running** as you move from one page to another.

If you need some pages to have a different layout, you can disable the master page for those specific pages.

## Important notes

- When using a master page, **its elements remain active and running during playback**. For example, if the master page contains a video, it will continue playing even when switching to other pages.
- Master pages are ideal for elements such as:
  - Background images or colors
  - Company logos
  - Scrolling messages or news tickers
  - Clocks or dynamic time displays
  - Video loops used as a decorative background
- If you do **not want the master page shown on a specific page**, you can turn off the "Show the Master Page on the Background of this Page" option in that page's **Style Properties**.
