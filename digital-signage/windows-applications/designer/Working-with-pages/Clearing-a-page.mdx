Clearing a page will **remove all elements** from the current page, leaving you with a blank page to redesign.  
**Note**: The page properties, such as name and background settings, will remain unchanged.

---

## **To Clear the Current Page**

1. Go to the **Page** menu.
2. Click **Clear Page**.

---

## **Tip**
- If you **accidentally clear a page**, you can **undo** this action:
  - Go to the **Home** menu and select **Undo** to restore the page's previous content.

---

## **Remarks**
- **Clearing a page** only removes its **contents**, not its **properties** or its place within the presentation.
