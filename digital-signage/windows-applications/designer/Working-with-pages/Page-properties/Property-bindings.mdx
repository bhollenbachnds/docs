Property bindings allow you to **dynamically link page properties** to external data sources. When the data source updates, the corresponding page property will automatically update during playback.

For example, if you **bind the Background Color** of a page to an XML file, **the background color will automatically change** when the value in the XML file changes.

## **Property Bindings Overview**

This section contains a **list of page properties** that can be bound to an external data source.  
To create a binding, you must define at least:

- **Data Provider**
- **Column (Field)**
- **Row (Record)**

---

### **Property**
- The **specific page property** to be bound (e.g., **Background Color**, **Visible**, etc.).
- **System-defined** — cannot be changed.

### **Type**
- The **data type** of the property (e.g., **Color**, **Boolean**, **Integer**).
- **System-defined** — cannot be changed.

### **Data Provider**
- Choose the **data provider** that supplies the data (e.g., XML, Excel, SQL, JSON).
- If no data providers are available, **create one first** in the data provider setup.

### **Column**
- Select the **data field** (column) within the data provider that contains the value for the property.

### **Row**
- Select the **record (row)** within the data provider that holds the desired value.

### **Scroll**
- **Enable this option** if data scrolling should be applied.
- When enabled, **Data Scrolling Properties** will dictate how the data is scrolled through during playback.

## **Example Use Case: Dynamic Page Visibility**

- Bind the **Visible** property of a page to a **cell in an Excel file**.
- If the Excel value is "1", the page will be shown.
- If the Excel value is "0", the page will be hidden.
- This allows **dynamic control** over which pages are shown, simply by editing the Excel file — useful for schedule-based content.

> **Tip**:  
Property bindings are powerful for **real-time adaptive content**. For example:
- Change background color based on real-time sensor data.
- Show or hide pages based on external scheduling files.
- Adjust transition effects dynamically.
