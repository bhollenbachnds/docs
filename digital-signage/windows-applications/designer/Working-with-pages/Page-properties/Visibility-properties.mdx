The **visibility properties** define whether a page will be shown during the playback of your presentation.

---

## **Visibility**

### **Visible**
- If **enabled**, the page will be **displayed** during presentation playback.
- If **disabled**, the page will **not** be shown when the presentation runs.

---

## **Visibility and Master Page**
- If the page is a **master page** and **visibility is turned off**, **all elements** on the master page will be **paused** during the period it is invisible.
- If a **rule** later makes the master page visible again, its elements (e.g., videos or scrolling content) will **resume** from where they paused.

> **Tip**:  
You can use the **Visible** property to **temporarily exclude a page** from your presentation **without deleting it** â€” useful for testing layouts or adjusting content without losing your design.
