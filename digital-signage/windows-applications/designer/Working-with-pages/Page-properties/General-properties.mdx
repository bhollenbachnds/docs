The **General Properties** section allows you to **identify each page** in your presentation and define **how long it will be displayed** during playback.

---

## **Identification**

### **Name**
- A **unique name** that identifies this page within your presentation.
- To check which names are already used, click the button next to the **Name** input field — this will show a list of all existing page names (including the name of the current page).
- **Note**: Each page name must be **unique** in the presentation.

---

## **Behavior**

### **Duration**
- **Defines how long** (in seconds) the page is displayed before moving to the next page.
- **Tip**: To view the **total duration of your presentation** and **each page’s duration**, click **Presentation Properties** on the **Presentation menu** and review the **Pages section** under the **General tab**.

---

## **Remarks**
- If your presentation contains **only one page**, the **Duration** setting is **ignored** during playback.
- If you are using **presentation rules, page rules, or element rules**, these may **override** the specified **Duration**, dynamically controlling when and how long a page is displayed.
- If **automatic page expiration** is enabled under **Interactivity properties**, this might also **overrule** the specified page **Duration**.
