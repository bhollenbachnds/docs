A quick and efficient way to compose a new presentation is by **importing pages** from other existing presentations. This helps **recycle previously designed content**, saving time and effort.

- You can use the **browse** button to locate the file.

## **Remarks**
- If a **page name conflict** occurs (i.e., if an imported page has the same name as an existing page), PADS4 will **automatically generate a new name** for the imported page.
- **Imported pages** will be added **directly after the currently active page** in your presentation.
- If imported pages **use data providers**, these data providers will also be **imported automatically** into your presentation.
