### **Important Notes**
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Using an **external OpenOffice file** *(outside the Content Library)* requires **manual file distribution**.
  - If the OpenOffice file is large, ensure **PADS4 has enough resources** for processing.
- **Security & Accessibility**:
  - If you are using a **PADS4 Data Server**, the file **must be accessible** from the server’s location.
  - Without a PADS4 Data Server, ensure **each PADS4 Viewer** can locate and access the specified OpenOffice file.
- **Offline Usage**:
  - You can **download** data from an **RSS feed** and save it as an **OpenOffice Calc file** for offline access.
  - To do this, open the **RSS feed in a browser**, select **View Source**, and save it as a **.txt or .csv file** before importing into OpenOffice.
