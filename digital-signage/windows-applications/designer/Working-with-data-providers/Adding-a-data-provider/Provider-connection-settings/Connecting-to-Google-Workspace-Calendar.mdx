## **Steps to Add/Modify a Google Workspace Calendar Connection in PADS4**

### **1. Start the Data Provider Wizard**

### **2. Authenticate with Google Workspace**

### **3. Select a Google Calendar**
- Choose the **Google Calendar** from which you want to retrieve event data.
- Enable **Group Recurrent Events** if you want to retrieve **only recurring events** instead of each individual instance.

## **Important Considerations**
- **Ensure Internet Access:**
  - If using a **PADS4 Data Server**, ensure that the **Google Calendar API** is **accessible** from the server.
  - If **not using a Data Server**, each **PADS4 Designer and Viewer** must have **direct internet access** to connect to Google.
- **Google Workspace Permissions:**
  - The authenticated user must have **sufficient access** to view the selected calendar.
- **Event Filtering:**
  - Use the **text substring filter** to show **only relevant calendar entries**.
- **Handling Recurring Events:**
  - Enabling **Group Recurrent Events** ensures that **only the main event** is shown, avoiding **duplicate instances**.

By completing these steps, you can successfully integrate **Google Workspace Calendar** with **PADS4** for real-time scheduling and event displays.
