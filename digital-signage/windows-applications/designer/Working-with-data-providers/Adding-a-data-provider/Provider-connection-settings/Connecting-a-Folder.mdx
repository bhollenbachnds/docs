The **Folder** provider type allows you to connect to a **specific folder** to retrieve and display its **file content**. You can include **all files** or filter them based on **extensions**. **Subfolders** can also be included if needed.

## **Steps to Add/Modify a Folder Connection in PADS4**

### **1. Start the Data Provider Wizard**
- Open the **Data Provider Wizard** by following the instructions in **Adding a Data Provider** or **Editing a Data Provider**.
- Select **Folder** as the **provider type**.

### **2. Specify Folder Connection Settings**
- Choose one of the following **source options**:
  - **Content Library:** Uses a folder from the **PADS4 Content Library** (Recommended).
  - **Folder:** Uses a **folder outside** the content library.

- **Enter the Folder Path**:
  - If using **Content Library**, provide the **relative path**.
  - If using an **external folder**, provide the **absolute path** (e.g., `C:\MyFolder`).
  - Use the **Browse** button to locate the folder.

- **Include Subfolders** *(Optional)*
  - Enable this option to include files **from subfolders** of the selected folder.

- **Set File Filters**
  - Use **Search Extension Restriction** to **filter specific file types** (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.mp4`).

- **Sort Files**
  - Use **Sorting File List** settings to **define the sorting order**.

### **3. Finalize the Connection**
- Click **Next** to proceed.
- Complete the wizard as described in **Adding a Data Provider**.

## **Best Practices**
- **Use the PADS4 Content Library**  
  - Files in the **Content Library** are **automatically synchronized** across **all PADS4 systems**.  
  - If you use an **external folder**, you must **manually distribute** the files across systems.

- **Avoid Shared Network Folders**  
  - **Network traffic may increase** when using a **mapped drive** or **UNC path** (`\\server\folder`).
  - This can **slow down** the **Viewer performance** when retrieving file lists or loading content.

- **Sorting Rules**  
  - **Folder-specific sorting** applies first.
  - **Generic sorting** (set in later wizard steps) **overrides folder sorting**.

## **Important Considerations**
- **Data Server Access**  
  - If using a **PADS4 Data Server**, ensure the **folder is accessible** from the **server's point of view**.
  - If **not using a Data Server**, each **PADS4 Designer and Viewer** must have **direct access** to the folder.

By following these steps, you can successfully **connect a folder** and retrieve its contents for use in **digital signage presentations**.
