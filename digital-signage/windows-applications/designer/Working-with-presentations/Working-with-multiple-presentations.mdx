## **Tip for Efficient Design**

Having multiple presentations open side by side is very useful when you want to **copy page elements** between them:

- Select the elements you want to copy.
- Use **Copy** from the **Clipboard section** of the **Home menu**.
- Switch to another presentation.
- Use **Paste** from the same Clipboard section.

This workflow makes it easy to reuse content between presentations.

## **Additional Remarks**

- The **ribbon bar** and **toolbox** will always apply to the **active presentation window** (the one currently in focus).
- You can also **right-click the tab area** of a presentation window to access arranging options via a context menu.
- **Close unused presentations** to maintain optimal performance in PADS4 Designer.
- To **close all other presentations except the current one**:  
  Right-click the tab area and choose **Close All But This** from the context menu.
