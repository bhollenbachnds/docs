In **PADS4 Designer**, you can select a **specific Viewer Type** when designing a presentation. This helps ensure that you only use elements supported by the selected Viewer. Some Viewer Types may **not support** certain elements—selecting a Viewer Type will **gray out** these unsupported elements to prevent their usage during the design process.

## **Why Select a Viewer Type?**
- **Prevent design errors** by only using elements supported by the Viewer.
- Make sure your presentation **runs smoothly** on the target Viewer without compatibility issues.
- Improve **workflow efficiency** by focusing only on available options.

## **How to Select a Viewer Type**

1. **Click on the "Presentation" tab** in the ribbon bar.  
   
2. **Go to the "Viewer Type" section.**  

3. **Select the desired Viewer Type** from the dropdown list.  
   - Example types: Windows Viewer, HTML5 Viewer, Android Viewer, etc.  

4. **Save your presentation**:  
   - In the **Content Library**, name your presentation and click **Save**.

## **What Happens After Selection?**

- **Unsupported elements** for the selected Viewer Type will be **grayed out** in the toolbox and element menus.
- You **won’t be able to add** these elements to your presentation, avoiding future playback issues.
- This helps ensure your presentation is **fully compatible** with the Viewer where it will be displayed.
