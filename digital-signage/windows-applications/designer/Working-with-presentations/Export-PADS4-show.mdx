When you want to **share a demo presentation** with another PADS4 user or **archive** a complete presentation, **Export PADS4 Show** is the recommended method. This functionality lets you create a **single zipped (.padsz) file** that contains both the **presentation file** and **all related content files** (images, videos, PDFs, database files, etc.).
