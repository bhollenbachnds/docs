The **Interactivity Properties** control how interactive presentations respond to **user inactivity** and define how **keyboard navigation** is handled during playback.

## **Page Keyboard Navigation**

### **Enable Navigation by Using Keyboard Keys**
When enabled, users can **navigate between pages** of your presentation using the keyboard on the **PADS4 Viewer PC**.  
Below are the available navigation keys:

| Keyboard Key                          | Action                                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Left arrow / Up arrow / Page Up       | Switch to the **previous page**                  |
| Right arrow / Down arrow / Page Down  | Switch to the **next page**                      |
| Home                                  | Switch to the **first page**                     |
| End                                   | Switch to the **last page**                      |

## **Expiration (Automatic Page Expiration)**

### **Automatic Page Expiration**
When enabled, the presentation will automatically perform a specified action if **no user interaction** (mouse click or key press) occurs within a defined period.

### **After x Second(s)**
Set the **number of seconds** of inactivity before an action is triggered.

### **Return to Page**
Specify which **page to return to** when the expiration time has been reached.  
This is typically used to return to a **home** or **welcome** page after a user has left the interactive presentation.

---

### **Tip**
Setting expiration properties is especially useful for **interactive kiosks** to ensure that the presentation **resets to a default page** when no user is interacting.

---

## **Remarks**

- If **Enable Navigation by Using Keyboard Keys** is turned on, **page durations** still apply.  
  For example, if a page is set to display for 30 seconds and no keys are pressed, the system will automatically **switch to the next page** when the duration ends.
- If **Synchronize Viewers** is enabled for a presentation, **interactivity functions** such as keyboard navigation and automatic page expiration **will no longer work**, since the presentation must remain in sync across all displays.
