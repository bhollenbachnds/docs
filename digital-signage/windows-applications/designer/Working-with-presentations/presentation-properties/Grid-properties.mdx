The **Grid Properties** define the grid system used when designing your presentation. Proper use of the grid can significantly **save time** and **improve alignment**, as page elements will automatically snap into place for consistent layout and positioning.

---

## **Grid Settings**

The **defined grid size** applies to all key operations in the design of your presentation, ensuring that page elements align precisely.

### **Width**  
- Sets the **horizontal spacing** of the grid in pixels.

### **Height**  
- Sets the **vertical spacing** of the grid in pixels.

## **Tip**

To **quickly toggle** the "Snap to Grid" function:

- Go to the **Home menu** and click **Snap to Grid**,  
**or**  
- Use the shortcut **Ctrl + G** to enable or disable snapping on the fly.

## **Remarks**

- **New presentations** will automatically **inherit grid settings** as defined in the **Options** under the **Tools menu**.
- Once set, **grid settings are saved within each presentation**, allowing different presentations to use different grids.
- Whether the **grid is shown** and whether elements **snap to the grid** is controlled by:
  - **Show Grid**
  - **Snap to Grid**  
These options are also found under **Options** in the **Tools menu**.
- **Note**: Grid settings **only apply** within the **PADS4 Designer** environment and **do not affect** how the presentation is displayed during playback.
