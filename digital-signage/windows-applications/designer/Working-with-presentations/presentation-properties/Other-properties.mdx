## **Proof of Play**

### **Log Presentation Statistics Info**
When this option is enabled, **detailed information** about the playback of your presentation will be **logged**.  
This data can be used to **prove** (for example, to advertisers) that specific content has been shown, **where**, **when**, and **for how long**.

### **How it Works:**
- **Exact playback information** is stored in a **log file** and **sent to the PADS4 Server** for **centralized logging**.
- All log data is stored in the **PADS4 billing database**, located on the **PADS4 Server PC**.
- You can **view and manage** this data using:
  - The **PADS4 Agent application**.
  - **Microsoft Access** (for direct database access).
  - The **PADS4 Software Development Kit (SDK)** to develop custom solutions for processing the data.

## **Important Note**

- **If logging is enabled**, it is **absolutely required** to set up a procedure to **manually or automatically process and clean up** the log data.
- **Failing to manage this log data** may result in the **PADS4 billing database** consuming all available disk space, as **PADS4 does not automatically delete old log entries**.
