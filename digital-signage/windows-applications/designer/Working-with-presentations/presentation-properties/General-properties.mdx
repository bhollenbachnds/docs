The **General Properties** section defines the **identity** of your presentation and manages the **sequence and characteristics** of its pages. This is essential for organizing, identifying, and controlling how your presentation runs.

---

## **Identification**

**Name**  
- The **presentation name** used to identify your presentation across PADS4 applications, including the PADS4 Scheduler.  
- By default, the **file name** (without extension) is used as the presentation name.  
- If you **manually adjust** the name, it will keep this new name, even if the file name changes later.

---

## **Pages Section**

The **Pages section** lists all the pages in your presentation and shows a **total duration** (sum of durations of all **visible** pages).

---

### **Editing Page Properties**

To adjust properties of any page:

1. **Select a page** in the list.
2. Use **Move Up** or **Move Down** to reorder pages.
3. **Visible**:  
   - Check to include the page during playback.  
   - Uncheck to skip it.
4. **Duration**:  
   - Set how long (in seconds) the page is shown.  
   - Note: If **presentation/page rules** control timing, this value may be overridden.
5. **Page Name**:  
   - Enter a unique name for the page.
6. **Effect**:  
   - Optional transition effect when the page appears during playback.

### **Removing Pages**

1. Select the page(s) to remove (use Shift or Ctrl for multiple selections).
2. Click **Remove** to delete them.

**Important**: Removing a page from this list **deletes it completely** from the presentation — not just from the playlist.

---

## **Remarks**

- It’s often easier to manage pages using the **Thumbnails window**, which shows visual previews and supports **drag-and-drop** for reordering.
- For specific page settings (like background images or scrolling), use the **Page Properties** window.
- **Rules** (presentation or page rules) may control page visibility and timing, and can override manual duration settings.
