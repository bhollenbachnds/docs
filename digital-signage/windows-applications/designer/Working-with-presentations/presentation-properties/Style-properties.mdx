The **Style properties** define how your presentation will be played, including options for synchronizing playback across multiple Viewers.

## **Synchronize Viewers**

### **Calculate Time of Page Change Based on Scheduled Time**

- **When enabled**, this option ensures that the presentation is **played synchronously** on all displays (Viewers) to which it has been scheduled.
- **When enabled**, dynamic page behaviors such as **conditional page skipping** (e.g., skipping a page when no data is available) **will no longer function**, as synchronization takes priority.

## **Example of Synchronized Playback**

If a presentation is scheduled to start at **10:00** and contains **two pages**, each displayed for **1 minute**, the playback would proceed as follows:

- **10:00 - 10:01**: Page 1 is displayed  
- **10:01 - 10:02**: Page 2 is displayed  
- **10:02 - 10:03**: Page 1 is displayed  
- **10:03 - 10:04**: Page 2 is displayed  
- **10:04 - 10:05**: Page 1 is displayed  
- **10:05 - 10:06**: Page 2 is displayed  

If the **PADS4 Viewer** is restarted at **10:03**, the presentation will **resume** by displaying **Page 2** for the remaining time until **10:04**, when it will switch to Page 1.

## **Remarks**

- **Synchronization is based on the system clock** of each PADS4 Viewer PC. The Viewer uses this clock to determine the correct point in time to display each page, ensuring alignment with other Viewers.
- Because synchronization is **time-based**, **the presentation may not always start from Page 1**.
- Synchronization works at the **page level**, meaning all participating displays switch to the next page **simultaneously**.
- The system automatically **resynchronizes on each page change**.
- Synchronization requires that the presentation contains at least **two pages**.
- Synchronization **depends on page duration**. It **will not work** if:
  - Page durations are disabled or ignored.
  - The presentation uses rules or options that bypass page timing.
- **External factors** such as high CPU usage on a Viewer PC may affect perfect synchronization, though the system will attempt to resynchronize at every page transition.
