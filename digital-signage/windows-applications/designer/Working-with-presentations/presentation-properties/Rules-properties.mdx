**Presentation rules** allow you to make your presentation **automatically respond to predefined situations**.  
For example, you can configure your presentation to **play advertising** when no real-time data is available to display.

## **Rules Section**

### **Defined Rules List**
Displays a list of all **presentation rules** currently defined for this presentation.  
For detailed instructions on how to create and manage rules, refer to **"Working with Rules."**

---

## **Default Page When No Rule Is Active**

### **Show this Page when No Rule is Active**
Select a **default fallback page** that will be shown **whenever none of the defined rule conditions are met**.  
This ensures that your presentation always has relevant content displayed, even if specific conditions for other pages are not satisfied.

## **Important Notes**

- **Presentation rules are continuously evaluated** during playback.  
- This means the system will **immediately switch pages** if a rule condition **becomes true or false**.
- As a result, **dynamic adjustments** to content can occur in real-time based on the current situation or data received.
