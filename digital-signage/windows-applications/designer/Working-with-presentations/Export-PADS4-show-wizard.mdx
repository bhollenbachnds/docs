The **Export PADS4 Show** wizard allows you to create a **single zipped (.padsz) file** that includes both the **presentation** and **all related content files**. This is essential when sending a **demo presentation** to another PADS4 user or for archiving purposes. The wizard ensures all necessary files are bundled, avoiding issues like missing images or videos during playback.

## **Content Review and Selection**

After clicking **Next**, the wizard will:
- **Identify all used files** in the presentation (images, videos, databases, etc.).
- Display a **list** including:
  - **File name**
  - **File type**
  - **Original size**

### **Important Indicators**
- **Files shown in red**:  
  - Located **outside** the PADS4 Content Library (e.g., other disk locations). These are **not synchronized** to Viewers automatically. 
  - You'll be warned during export, and users will be notified during import.
- **Size listed as 'Not found'**:  
  - Referenced in the presentation but **missing**. These files will **not** be included in the export.

## **Managing Files in Export List**

- **Add…**:  
  Add **individual files** (e.g., a README or support document).
- **Add folder…**:  
  Add an **entire folder**, including subfolders.
- **Remove**:  
  Remove selected files or folders from the export list.

## **Handling Missing or External Files**

- **Missing files**:
  - Appear **in red** and **marked as 'Not found'**.
  - Export will proceed but a **warning** is shown.
  - During import, users are **notified** about the missing files.
  
- **Files outside the PADS4 Content Library**:
  - Appear **in red**.
  - Can be exported, but:
    - **Warning** is displayed during export.
    - Users are notified during import that these files are external and not part of the automatically synchronized content.

**Recommendation**:  
Ensure **all files** are stored in the **PADS4 Content Library** to avoid these issues and guarantee proper synchronization with Viewers.

## **Finalizing the Export**

- After reviewing and adjusting the file list, press **Finish** to begin creating the `.padsz` file.
- **Progress bar** will show the export progress — this may take time depending on file sizes.
- Once complete, a single **PADS4 Show (.padsz)** file will be created, ready to share or archive.
