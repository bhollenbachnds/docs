**Viewer Variables** are powerful tools that allow dynamic, context-driven content in PADS4 presentations. They are **customizable variables** assigned to each Viewer and automatically filled in during the display of presentations. These variables enable content personalization **without the need to create multiple presentations** for different locations or devices.

---

## **What Are Viewer Variables?**

- **Viewer-specific placeholders** that can dynamically adjust content shown in presentations.
- Used in **text, data providers, filters, rules, property bindings**, and more.
- **Identified** in content using the format:  
  `#<Viewer Variable name>#`  
  _(Example: `#Store Name#`)_

---

## **Where to Define Viewer Variables?**

### **1. System Management Application (Recommended)**
- **Add and manage** Viewer Variables.
- Assign **default values** that apply to all Viewers.
- Ensures **centralized control** and prevents unauthorized creation or deletion via PADS4 Agent.

### **2. PADS4 Agent**
- Adjust **values for individual Viewers** under the **Server tab**.
- Overwrites the default value assigned in System Management.

### **3. Viewer Options Window (on the Viewer device)**
- Adjust Viewer Variables directly on the Viewer for **local adjustments**.

## **Example: Personalized Text with Viewer Variables**

If you define a Viewer Variable `#Store Name#` with the default value **"New York Health"**, and use this text in a Text Element:

> **Welcome to the #Store Name#.**

During playback, it will automatically display:

> **Welcome to the New York Health.**

If you update the variable in PADS4 Agent or Viewer options (e.g., to "Chicago Health"), the content will adjust **without changing the presentation**.

## **Where Can Viewer Variables Be Used?**

- **Text fields** in elements.
- **Data Providers** (queries, filters, expressions, sort, file paths).
- **Rules** for dynamic content behavior.
- **Property bindings**.
- **Playlists** for media sequences.
- **File references** (e.g., dynamically select images based on Viewer location).

## **Automation Examples Using Viewer Variables**

| **Use Case**                                | **Example**                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personalized store information              | Show specific store name and address per Viewer.                |
| Product selection based on store size       | Filter products based on Viewer Variable like `#StoreSize#`.    |
| Region-specific data                        | Use `#Country#` or GPS-based Viewer Variables for localized content. |
| Dynamic map display                         | Show different maps depending on location variable.             |

## **When Are Viewer Variables Transformed into Actual Values?**

| **Context**                                      | **When Replaced**                                                     |
|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inside data sources (SQL, XML, JSON, RSS)**    | When Viewer reads or receives data from the source.                  |
| **In Data Providers (filter, sort, expressions)**| At start of data retrieval. New variable values affect next retrieval.|
| **Inside presentations (text, image, video)**    | At presentation start.                                                |
| **In rules (element, page, presentation rules)** | At time the rule is checked (not auto-updated if variable changes).  |
| **Property bindings (with data provider)**       | On scheduled data read.                                                |
| **Playlists**                                   | Replaced when loaded. For alternated playlists, updated at next cycle. |

## **Playlist Handling with Viewer Variables**

- **Single-item, non-alternating playlist**:  
  Viewer Variable is replaced at load time and **remains static** until next load.
- **Alternating playlist**:  
  Viewer Variable is updated **on each interval**, allowing dynamic changes.

---

## **Important Notes**

- **Do NOT use Viewer Variables for constantly changing values.**  
  Viewer Variables are **not designed** to function as high-frequency data sources (use Data Providers for that).
- Changes in Viewer Variables **do not automatically trigger** re-evaluation of all rules or content refresh unless reloaded.
- **Files outside Content Library** referenced with Viewer Variables may **not synchronize properly**—keep files inside the Content Library.

---

## **Key Benefits**

- **Centralized content management** with dynamic local personalization.
- **Single presentation** serving multiple Viewers with unique content.
- Easy to update and maintain—**change the variable value, not the presentation**.
- Enhances **automation and targeted communication** without complex redesign.
