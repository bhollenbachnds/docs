---

## **Key Features**
- Imports both **presentation and content files** into a specified folder.
- **Automatically updates** all file references to the new location.
- Enables **content reorganization** by exporting and importing with updated folder structures.
- Allows **removal of specific files** from the import if needed.

### **3. Optional Adjustments Before Import**

#### **Choose Destination Folder**
- You can **specify a new folder** where the presentation and content should be stored.
- Use the **[...] button** to browse and select a folder.
- **Note**:  
  All file references in the presentation will be **automatically updated** to reflect this new location. This is useful for **restructuring your content library**.

---

## **Important Notes & Warnings**

- **Files shown in red**:
  - These were located **outside the Content Library** during export.
  - **Warning**: They will **not** be synchronized automatically to Viewers.  
    Consider moving them into the Content Library for proper syncing.
- **Size marked as 'Not found'**:
  - Indicates that the file was referenced but **missing** at the time of export.  
    These files won't be included in the import.

---

## **4. Completing the Import**

- Once everything is set, press **Finish** to start the import process.
- The wizard will extract all files and adjust file references.
- When the import is done:
  - The **presentation will open** automatically.
  - **Note**: The imported presentation is **not yet stored** in the system — remember to **Save** it to finalize.

---

## **Use Case Example: Restructuring Folders**
- You can **export** an existing presentation as a PADS4 Show, 
- **Import** it into a **new destination folder**, 
- And PADS4 will **automatically update all file references** to match the new location — simplifying folder structure changes.

---

## **Final Tip**
- Always check the **content list** during import for files marked in red to ensure no critical content is missing or misplaced.
