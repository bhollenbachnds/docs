PADS4 Designer allows you to **save your presentation** under its current name or create a **copy under a different name**. When saving as a copy, the original presentation remains unchanged, and you continue working on the newly saved copy.

By default, presentations are saved in the **PADS4 Content Library**, but you can also choose to save them in other locations.

## **Important Notes and Tips**

- A `*` (asterisk) in the presentation's tab header indicates that there are **unsaved changes**.
- If PADS4 Designer is opened via **PADS4 Scheduler**, you will **not** see a `Save` button. Instead:
  - Use **Schedule...** to save and schedule the presentation directly in the PADS4 system.
  - Use **Update** to modify an already scheduled presentation.
  - To save a **local copy**, use `Save As` from the File menu.
- If you open a **PADS4 3.1 SR1 presentation**, it will be **automatically converted** to the new PADS4 format (.padsx), ensuring the original file is **not overwritten**.
