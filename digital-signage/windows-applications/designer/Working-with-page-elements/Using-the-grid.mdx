Before you start designing a presentation, it is **highly recommended** to review and configure the **grid options**.  
Using the grid properly can save **a lot of time** as it helps **automatically position and size** page elements in line with each other.

2. Go to the **Design Window** tab.  
3. Adjust one or more of the grid settings to your preference.

## Grid Settings Explained  

### **Grid Width/Height**  
- Define the **default grid width and height** in pixels.  
- These sizes will be applied to any **new presentation** you create.  

### **Show Grid**  
- Choose whether the **grid should be visible or hidden** while designing.  

### **Snap to Grid**  
- When enabled, all **future page elements** will **snap** to the defined grid, ensuring perfect alignment.

## Tip  

You can **temporarily disable** the **Snap to Grid** function while designing by selecting **Snap to Grid** on the **Home menu**.

## Important Remarks  

- When a new presentation is created, it will **inherit** the grid width and height settings defined in the options.  
- After a presentation is created, **grid settings are stored within that presentation**, allowing for **unique grid settings per presentation**.  
- To **modify the grid** for an existing presentation, use **Presentation Properties** from the **Presentation menu**.  
- Even if **Show Grid** is turned off, **Snap to Grid** can still function.  
- Turning on **Snap to Grid** will only affect **future operations**â€”it will **not retroactively adjust existing page elements**.
