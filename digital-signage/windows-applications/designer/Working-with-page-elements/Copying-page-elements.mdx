Page elements can be copied **within the same page**, **to another page** in the same presentation, or **to another presentation**.

## To Copy Page Elements Within the Same Page

1. **Select** the page elements you want to copy (see *Selecting page elements* for details).  
2. Click **Copy** on the **Home** menu.  
3. Click **Paste** on the **Home** menu.  

- The pasted elements will appear **below the original elements**, as long as there is enough space left.  

### Note:  
If all selected elements are connected to a data provider and share the same **Row** property:  
- When pasted, the **Row** property will automatically **increment by 1**.  
- However, **repeated pasting** will not keep incrementing (e.g., not 2, 3, etc.).  
- To achieve consecutive rows, you must repeat **both Copy and Paste** for each step.

## Remarks

- Pasted elements will **only** be placed at the chosen position if they **fit within the page boundaries**.  
- If they do not fit, the system will **auto-adjust** the position to ensure all elements are within the page.  
- To paste elements at a **specific position**:
  - **Right-click** on the target position on the page.
  - Select **Paste** from the context menu â€” elements will be pasted there if space allows.
