Each time you perform a task that changes your page design, PADS4 Designer takes a snapshot of the current situation. This enables you to **go back** to previous states when you make a mistake. PADS4 Designer offers built-in functions to move **backward** and **forward** through your design steps.

---

## To Go One Step Back in Your Page Design:

- Click **Undo** on the **Home** menu.

You can use **Undo** multiple times to go back several steps. After going back, you can also move forward again if needed.

---

## To Go One Step Forward in Your Page Design:

- Click **Redo** on the **Home** menu.

---

## To Go Directly to a Specific Step in Your Page Design:

1. Click the **Undo List** drop-down on the **Home** menu.
2. Select the step you want to restore from the list.

---

## Remarks:

- **Undo** and **Redo** functions only apply **within the same page**.  
- Each page maintains its **own history of design steps**.
- When you switch between pages, you will see the undo list relevant to that specific page.
