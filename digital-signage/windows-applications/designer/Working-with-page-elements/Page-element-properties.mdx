Each page element has a set of **properties** that determine its behavior and appearance within the page.

## To Edit the Properties of a Single Page Element  

1. **Select** the element (for example, by clicking on it).  
2. Click **Element Properties** on the **Elements menu**.  
3. Adjust one or more settings in the properties window.  
4. Click **OK** to save the changes and return to your presentation, or click **Apply** to save the changes without closing the properties window.

## To Edit the Properties of Multiple Page Elements  

1. **Select multiple elements** (see *Selecting multiple page elements*).  
2. Make sure the correct element is marked as the **primary selected item**.  
3. Click **Element Properties** on the **Elements menu**.  
4. Adjust the properties in the window. Note that this window shows the properties of the **primary selected item**.  
5. Click **OK** or **Apply** to apply the changes to all selected elements.

### Tip  
Editing properties for multiple elements in one action **saves time** and **reduces mistakes**.  

If you select different types of elements (like text, pictures, videos), when you apply changes:  
- The system checks if each element supports the property.  
- If supported, the property is updated.  
- If not supported, that element is skipped.

## Remarks  

- If the **show preview** option is enabled in the properties window, a **preview window** will appear to immediately show the effect of your changes.  
- If you accidentally change something, use **Undo** on the Home menu to revert changes.  
- **Note**: Clicking **OK** automatically saves changes. You **don’t need to click Apply** before clicking OK — both actions have the same effect when combined.
