Inverting the selection allows you to **quickly swap** selected and unselected page elements on the **current page**.  
All **selected elements** will become **unselected**, and all **unselected elements** will become **selected**.

## To Invert the Selection on the Current Page  

- Go to the **Elements** menu.  
- Click **Invert Selection**.

### Tip  
If you want to select **almost all** page elements, it's often faster to:  
1. **Select** only the few elements you **don't** want.  
2. Then use **Invert Selection** to select everything else in one step.
