In a selection of page elements, there is always **one element marked as the primary selected item**.  

You can recognize the primary selected item by its **black grab handles with a white border**, while other selected items have **white grab handles with a black border**.  

---

## Purpose of the Primary Selected Item  

The **primary selected item** serves as the **reference point** when applying functions to multiple selected elements.  

---

### Example 1 — Alignment  
If you use the **Align Lefts** function on several selected items, **all elements will align to the left side of the primary selected item**.  

---

### Example 2 — Applying Properties  
When multiple text elements are selected and **Element Properties** is clicked (from the Elements menu), the **Text Properties window** will show the properties of the **primary selected item**.  
If you adjust a property and click **Apply**, the change will be applied to **all selected text elements**.

## How to Set a Primary Selected Item  

To make a selected page element the **primary selected item**, **click on that element again** while it is part of the selection.  

---

### Note  
If the elements on your page are locked, the grab handles' background color will appear **gray** instead of black or white.  
Still, the **primary selected item** will remain recognizable by its **white border**.
