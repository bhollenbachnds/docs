To perform **any action** (such as moving, resizing, or deleting) on page elements, you must **first select them**.  
Sometimes elements are **automatically selected** (for example, right after creation), but in other cases, **manual selection** is required.  

When a page element is selected, it will show **eight grab handles** — one at each corner and one at the middle of each side.
