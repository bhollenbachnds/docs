## To Resize One or More Page Elements on the Current Page:

2. Position the mouse pointer **over one of the grab handles** of any selected element.
3. **Press and hold** the left mouse button.
4. **Drag** the mouse pointer to adjust the size of the selected elements.
5. **Release** the mouse button to apply the new size.

## Remarks:

- If **Lock Elements** is enabled on the **Home** menu, resizing elements will **not** be possible.
- If a page element's size is set to **Automatic size** (e.g., text elements), resizing will **not** be possible. This is indicated by **gray grab handles** instead of black or white ones.

## Tips:

- You can **abort resizing** by pressing **[Esc]** during the process.
- For **precise resizing**, use the keyboard:
  - Hold **[Shift]** and use the **arrow keys** to resize.
  - If **Snap to Grid** is enabled, elements will resize by one grid unit.
  - If **Snap to Grid** is disabled, elements will resize by one pixel.
- To adjust Snap to Grid settings, go to the **Options** window.
- If you **accidentally resized** elements, you can always click **Undo** on the **Home** menu to restore the previous situation.
