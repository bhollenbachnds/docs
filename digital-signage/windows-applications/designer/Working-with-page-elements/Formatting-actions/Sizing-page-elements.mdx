The size of elements on a page can be adjusted **relative to each other**, **to the grid**, or **to the page** for consistent design alignment.

---

## 1. Adjusting Size to Each Other

### To make selected elements the same size:
1. **Select** at least **two page elements**. (See *Selecting Page Elements* for details.)
2. **Mark one element** as the **primary selected item**.
3. Click **Size** on the **Elements** menu.
4. Choose one of the following options:

| Menu Item     | Function                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Same Width** | All selected elements will have the **same width** as the primary item. |
| **Same Height**| All selected elements will have the **same height** as the primary item.|
| **Same Size** | All selected elements will have both the **same width and height** as the primary item. |

## 2. Adjusting Size to the Grid

### To align elements' size to the grid:
1. **Select** the page elements you want to resize to fit the grid.
2. Click **Size** on the **Elements** menu and choose **Size to Grid**.

---

## 3. Adjusting Size to the Page

### To fit elements' size to the entire page:
1. **Select** the page elements to adjust.
2. Click **Size** on the **Elements** menu and choose **Size to Page**.

## Remarks

- Sizing **to each other** requires selecting at least **two elements**.
- If a page element is set to **Automatic size** (e.g., Text element), sizing adjustments may **not apply**.
- If **Snap to Grid** is enabled, **Size to Grid** may **have no additional effect**, as elements are already aligned to the grid.
