## How to Center Page Elements Within the Current Page

1. **Select** the page elements you want to center.  
   (See *Selecting Page Elements* for details.)

2. Click **Center** on the **Elements** menu.

3. Choose one of the following centering options:

| Menu Item           | Function                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Horizontal**      | Centers the selected elements **horizontally** within the page.|
| **Vertical**        | Centers the selected elements **vertically** within the page.  |
| **Center in Page**  | Centers the selected elements **both horizontally and vertically** within the page. |

## Remarks

- When **multiple elements** are selected, they are treated **as a group** and centered **as a whole**, not individually.
- Centering helps ensure that elements are visually balanced within the design space.
