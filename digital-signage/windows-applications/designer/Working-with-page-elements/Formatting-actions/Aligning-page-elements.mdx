   (See *Selecting Page Elements* for detailed instructions.)

2. **Make one element the primary selected item** (the reference for alignment).

3. Click **Align** on the **Elements** menu.

4. Choose one of the following alignment options:

| Menu Item  | Function                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Lefts**  | Aligns all selected elements horizontally to the **left** of the primary selected element.  |
| **Centers**| Aligns all selected elements horizontally to the **center** of the primary selected element.|

## Aligning Page Elements to the Grid

1. **Select** the page elements you want to align to the grid.  

2. Click **Align** on the **Elements** menu, then select **To Grid**.

## Remarks

- **At least two elements** must be selected to enable the alignment functions relative to each other.
- If **Snap to Grid** is already enabled, using **Align to Grid** will **have no additional effect**, as elements will already align to the nearest grid points when moved or resized.
