Page elements can be **placed in front of or behind** other elements on the page. To control which element appears on top, you need to adjust the **display order**.

### Tip
Use the **Elements window** to check and manage the current display order of page elements. The list reflects the stacking order from background to foreground.

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bring to Front** | Place the selected elements at the top (foreground).       |

### Important Notes

- **Flash elements** and **web page elements** (except those running in screenshot mode) are **always placed in front** of other page elements, regardless of the specified display order.
- If a page element does **not overlap** with other elements, adjusting its order (e.g., "Bring Forward") may have **no visible effect**.
- If you select **multiple elements**, display order adjustments will be applied **individually** to each selected element.
