## **Graceful Degradation and Hardware Changes**

### **Grace Period**
- If hardware changes are detected, PADS4 allows a **7-day grace period** to reactivate the system.
- During this period, a message will appear upon login prompting reactivation.

### **Reactivation Process**
1. Contact your reseller with your **PADS4 product key**.
2. Reseller will coordinate with **Net Display Systems (NDS)** for approval.
3. After approval, use **License Wizard** on the PADS4 Server:
   - Select **Reactivate current installation**.
   - System will connect to NDS and reset hardware changes.
4. If no internet is available, use **offline activation** via License Wizard.

> **Important**: Reactivate before the grace period ends, or PADS4 will stop functioning.

### **Hardware Detection Parameters**
PADS4 monitors:
- Operating System
- Processor ID
- OS Install Date and Serial Number
- BIOS Serial Number and Version
- Network Adapter and MAC Address
- Windows Activation Code

### **Preventing Issues on Virtual Servers**
- Ensure **MAC address is fixed**.
- Avoid **Bluetooth device sharing** to prevent virtual adapter changes.
