These properties control how **text items** appear and move within the **scrolling text element**.

## **Scroll Options**  

### **Text Scroll Options**  
Determine how new text is introduced into the scrolling text element:  

| **Option** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Line by Line** | Displays one line at a time. Each line is shown separately, and the next line appears only after the previous one disappears. |
| **Directly After Previous Text** | New text is placed **immediately after** the previous text, ensuring a continuous scrolling effect with no gaps. |
| **When Previous Text is Scrolled Out** | New text starts **only after** the previous text has **fully disappeared** from view. |

### **Additional Settings**  

#### **Concatenate Multiple Text Lines to One Single Line**  
- If enabled, **hard returns (line breaks)** inside a single text entry are **removed**.  
- The entire text is treated as **one continuous line** during scrolling.  
- Cannot be used in combination with **Line by Line** mode.  

#### **Do Not Scroll When the Text Fits**  
- When enabled, PADS4 calculates whether the **entire text (including separators)** fits within the **element area**.  
- If the text fits, it will remain **static** instead of scrolling.  
- If the text **exceeds** the element area, scrolling will **automatically start**.  

#### **Show Changes in Text Immediately**  
- When connected to a **data source**, enabling this setting ensures that **any text updates are reflected immediately**.  
- The scrolling process is **aborted**, and the **new text begins scrolling immediately**.

## **Remarks**  
- **"Line by Line" mode** cannot be used with **"Concatenate Multiple Text Lines to One Single Line"**, as they **conflict in behavior**.  
- Ensuring **seamless scrolling** requires careful configuration of **text length, separator spacing, and update frequency**.
