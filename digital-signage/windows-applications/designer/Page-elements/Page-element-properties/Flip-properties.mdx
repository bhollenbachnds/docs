These properties allow you to **create a mirrored (reversed)** version of your element's content, either horizontally, vertically, or both.

### Flip Options

- **Flip Horizontal**  
  Reverses the content **horizontally** (left-to-right mirror effect).

- **Flip Vertical**  
  Reverses the content **vertically** (top-to-bottom mirror effect).

### Remarks

- You can **combine** both options to flip the content **in both directions**.
- Useful for **design effects** or adjusting content alignment as needed for specific layouts.
