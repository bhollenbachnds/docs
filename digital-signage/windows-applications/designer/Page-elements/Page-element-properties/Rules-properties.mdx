The Rules properties allow you to define behaviors for your element that automatically respond to specific conditions. By using rules, you can control how your element reacts during playback based on real-time situations. For example, you can make an element visible only when a certain condition is met, or adjust its position dynamically.

**Rules**  
Displays a list of defined rules for the element. You can add, edit, remove, and manage rules here. Each rule defines a condition and the action to be executed when that condition is met.

**Purpose**  
Rules are used to dynamically adjust properties of the element, such as visibility, size, position, color, and other attributes, based on real-time data or logical conditions.

**Examples of usage**  
- Show or hide the element when a data value changes.
- Change the color of an element when a threshold is exceeded.
- Move or resize elements in response to external events or data updates.

**Important**  
For more detailed information on how to create and manage rules, refer to the "Working with rules" section.
