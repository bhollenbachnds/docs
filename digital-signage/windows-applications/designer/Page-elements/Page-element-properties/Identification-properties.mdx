### Identification

- **Name**  
  A **unique name** that identifies the element within the page of your presentation.  
  - This name is essential for managing and organizing elements on your page.
  - To check for available names or avoid duplicates, **click the button** next to the Name input field â€” this helps ensure uniqueness.

### Remarks

- The **element name** specified here will also appear in the **Elements window**, where you can manage elements and adjust their **display order**.
- By default, the system will **automatically generate** a **unique and localized name** for each element when it is created. You can **modify this name** as needed for better organization and reference within your project.
