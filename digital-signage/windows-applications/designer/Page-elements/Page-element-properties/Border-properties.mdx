These properties define the **appearance and behavior of borders** around your element, including color, width, and corner styling.

### Border

- **Show**:  
  Enable or disable the display of a border around your element.  
  - **Enabled**: The element will have a visible border.
  - **Disabled**: No border will be shown.

- **Color**:  
  Choose a color for the border.  
  You can:
  - Select a **fixed color**.
  - Use a **gradient** with two or three colors.
  - Apply a **texture or pattern**.  
  (Refer to *Using the color picker* for more details on advanced options.)

- **Width**:  
  Set the thickness of the border in pixels.

- **Corner Radius**:  
  Set the **roundness of the corners**.  
  - A higher value creates more rounded corners.
  - A value of **0** means sharp, right-angled corners.

### Remarks

- **Positioning**:  
  The border is **always drawn inside** the elementâ€™s boundaries.  
  This means:
  - The **size of the element itself does not change** when adding a border.
  - The **inner content area shrinks** based on the border width, which may impact the layout and appearance of content like text or images.
