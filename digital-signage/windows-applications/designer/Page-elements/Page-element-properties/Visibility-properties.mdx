These properties determine the **visibility** of your element during playback.

---

### **Visibility**

- **Visible**  
  When **switched off**, the element **will not be displayed** during playback of your presentation.

- **Hide when there is no Content**  
  If **enabled**, the element will be **hidden automatically when there is no content** to display.

---

### **Remarks**

- **Not all elements** support all of these properties.  
- The **Visible** property is often used together with **element rules**, allowing you to **show or hide** an element based on certain conditions.  
- The **Hide when there is no content** property is useful for **picture elements** when layering multiple images. If the top image is empty, it will be hidden, revealing the images beneath it. This is helpful for dynamic content areas (e.g., switching logos depending on context).  
- **Note:** If a **video element** becomes invisible, its **audio will also stop** playing.
