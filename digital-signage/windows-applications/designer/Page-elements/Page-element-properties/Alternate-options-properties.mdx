These properties control how an element switches between items in its playlist during playback.

### Play Entire Play List

- **If disabled**:  
  Only the **first playlist item** will be played.  

- **If enabled**:  
  All items in the playlist will be played based on one of the following methods:  

#### Playback Methods (when "Play Entire Play List" is enabled)

1. **Play using Play List Durations**:  
   Each playlist item will play for the duration **defined within the playlist** itself.

2. **Play using Page Alternate Interval**:  
   All playlist items will play for the **same fixed duration**, as specified in the **Alternate Interval** of the Page Properties.  

   **Important Note**:  
   - When this option is used, **multiple elements** using it will **synchronize** their playlist switching.  
   - If elements have a different number of playlist items, the system will calculate which item should display at each time point, so they remain aligned.

### Example of Synchronization

Consider **two elements** with different playlist lengths:  

| **Element 1 (4 items)** | **Element 2 (2 items)** |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Playlist item 1         | Playlist item 1         |
| Playlist item 2         | Playlist item 2         |
| Playlist item 3         | Playlist item 1         |
| Playlist item 4         | Playlist item 2         |
| Playlist item 1         | Playlist item 1         |
| Playlist item 2         | Playlist item 2         |

In this example:  
- **Playlist item 1** of both elements will **always be shown at the same time**.  
- The system automatically aligns cycles, even with different list lengths.

### Synchronized Playback Across Viewers

When **Play using Page Alternate Interval** is active, the alternation of playlist items is **synchronized across all Viewers** (screens/players).  
- This ensures **simultaneous alternation** on all connected displays.  
- Make sure system synchronization settings are properly configured to support this behavior.

### Summary

- **Play Entire Play List**: Enables cycling through all playlist items.
- Choose between **individual item durations** or a **uniform alternate interval**.
- Synchronization keeps multiple elements and devices in sync.
- Helpful for coordinated content display across multiple areas or screens.
