These properties determine the shadow settings for your element, including shadow angle, color, distance, softness, and transparency.

### Shadow

- **Show**  
Enable or disable the display of a shadow for your element.

- **Angle**  
Set the direction in which the shadow will be drawn. You can either choose a predefined angle or manually enter the angle in degrees. The specified degrees are counted clockwise.

- **Color**  
Select the color of the shadow. You can choose a solid color or use a gradient, texture, or pattern. See "Using the color picker" for a complete explanation of available options.

- **Distance**  
The distance (in pixels) between the element and the end of the shadow. The shadow always starts at the element, and this value determines how far it extends.

- **Softness**  
Controls how sharp or soft the shadow appears.

- **Transparency**  
Sets the level of transparency for the shadow. Values range from 0% (fully visible) to 100% (fully transparent).

**Remarks**  
- The way shadows are drawn depends on the type of element.  
- For text elements, the shadow applies directly to the text.  
- For picture elements, the shadow is drawn outside the elementâ€™s boundaries.
