These properties define the background image of your element.  

### Background Image

- **Picture from**:  
  Select the image source using the drop-down list. You can choose:  
  - **Content Library**: Recommended option. The image will be part of your synchronized content library, ensuring it's available on all systems.
  - **File**: Select a picture directly from your file system. **Note**: Files chosen from disk are **not synchronized** automatically and must be manually distributed to other systems if needed.

---

### Transparency

- Set the **transparency level** for the background image.
- A value **higher than 0** will make the image partially transparent, allowing the background color to be visible through the image.
- This feature is useful for **softening the image**, which can improve the visual appearance when used as a background.

---

### Picture Size

- **Original Size**: Display the image using its natural dimensions.
- **Stretch to Fit**: Resize the image to fully cover the element's background area, regardless of its original dimensions.

---

### Remarks

- If the element **supports transparency**, you can also configure the **background color** to be transparent.
- In some cases, the **background color** will be visible when:
  - **No content** is displayed.
  - The content does **not completely cover** the background area.
