These properties allow you to add a **blinking effect** to your element, either by making the element appear and disappear or by changing its colors.

### Blinking

- **Blink**:  
  Enable or disable blinking for your element.  
  - **Enabled**: The element will toggle between visible and invisible at a defined frequency.  
  - **Disabled**: The element will remain static without blinking.

- **Use Different for Blinking**:  
  When this option is enabled, the element will **not** disappear. Instead, its colors will alternate between the normal colors and the specified **Foreground Color** and **Background Color** during the blinking cycle.  
  - This ensures that content stays visible at all times while still drawing attention through color changes.

---

### Foreground Color

- Defines the **alternative foreground color** used when the element is in its "blink" state.  
- Can be used, for example, to change text color during blinking.

---

### Background Color

- Defines the **alternative background color** used when the element is in its "blink" state.  
- Works well in combination with the foreground color to create a strong visual effect.

### Remarks

- **Synchronization**:  
  Blinking effects are **automatically synchronized** between different Viewers. This ensures that blinking occurs **simultaneously** on all screens in a networked setup.

- **Blink Frequency**:  
  The frequency at which blinking occurs is controlled at the **page level** to ensure consistent timing across elements on the same page.

- **Compatibility**:  
  Not all properties (such as color change during blinking) are available for every type of element. This may depend on the element's nature and content type.

### Tip

Using **different colors for blinking** (instead of making the element invisible) can act as a color inversion effect â€” making the element stand out while **keeping the content visible**. This approach is useful when you want to emphasize important information **without hiding** it.
