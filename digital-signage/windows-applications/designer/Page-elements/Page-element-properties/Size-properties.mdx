These properties determine the width and height of your page element.

### **Size**

- **Automatic**  
  If selected, the element’s size is automatically adjusted to fit its content.

- **Manual**  
  If selected, the size of the element is determined by the specified **Width** and **Height**.

- **Width**  
  The width (in pixels) of the element.

- **Height**  
  The height (in pixels) of the element.

**Tip:**  
To adjust the manual size of your element, you can use percentage input fields. Enabling **Lock Aspect Ratio** ensures the element maintains its original width-to-height ratio. Note that percentage adjustments and aspect ratio locking are only for resizing purposes and will **not** be saved as element properties.

### **Stretching Options**

- **None**  
  The content is not stretched. If larger than the element, it will be clipped to fit.

- **Stretch**  
  The content is automatically resized to exactly fill the element's boundaries.

- **Uniform**  
  The content is scaled to fit within the element while preserving the original aspect ratio.

- **Uniform to Fill**  
  The content is scaled to completely fill the element, preserving the original aspect ratio. Parts of the content may be clipped, depending on the element’s horizontal and vertical alignment settings.

### **Remarks**

- Not all elements support every stretching option (e.g., **Uniform to Fill**).
- If **Snap to Grid** is enabled, size properties can still accept custom values that don't conform to the grid.
- When **Automatic** size is selected, the element's size is fully determined by its content, regardless of Snap to Grid settings.
- Elements with **Automatic** size can't be resized manually using the mouse or arrow keys — indicated by gray grab handles.
- If **Automatic** size and alignment properties are set, alignment settings will influence how the element resizes (e.g., resizing from the left if horizontally aligned right).

**Tip:**  
For the best quality, display content at its original size whenever possible.
