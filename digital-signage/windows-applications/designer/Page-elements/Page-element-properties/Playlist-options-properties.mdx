### Play List

You can choose from the following options:

| **Option**                         | **Description**                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Auto Repeat**                     | The element will **automatically restart** playing from the first item when all play list items are done. This creates a **continuous loop**. |
| **Play Once**                       | The element will play all items **only once**. After finishing the last item, the element will be **made invisible**. |
| **Play Once and Go to Next Page**   | The element will play all items **once** and, upon completion, will **automatically switch to the next page** of your presentation. |
| **Sync Repeat**                     | Enables **synchronized playback** of the element across **multiple displays** for seamless multi-screen content flow. **Note**: This feature works only on **HTML5 Viewers**. |

### Remarks

- **Important**: These play list options apply **only when** the **"Play entire Play List"** option is enabled in the **Alternate Options** section.
- Use **Sync Repeat** for synchronized content across multi-screen setups, ensuring a **cohesive and coordinated presentation flow**.
