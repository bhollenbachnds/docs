These properties determine the **incoming transition effect** for the content of your element.

---

### **Transition Effect**

- **Effect**  
  Select the **transition effect** for your content from the drop-down list.

- **Duration**  
  Choose a **predefined duration** or **manually specify** the duration (in seconds) for how long the transition effect should last.

---

### **Remarks**

- **Line** and **Shape** elements do **not** contain actual content, so applying a transition effect to these elements will **only** affect their visibility when they appear.
- It is **not recommended** to combine **transition effects** with **blinking**, as this may cause **conflicts** and **unpredictable behavior** during playback.
