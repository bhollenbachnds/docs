Elements can be connected to an **external data source** (such as a SQL Server database, Microsoft Excel file, or RSS feed) to display **real-time data**. These properties define how the element connects to that data source, and which **column** and **row** are used for the content.

---

### Data Provider Info

- **No external data connection**  
  The element is **not connected** to a data source. It will display **fixed content** as specified directly in the element settings.

- **External data from the following data source**  
  The element is connected to a **data provider**, and specific **column** and **row** are used to deliver real-time content.

---

### Data Provider Components

- **Data Provider**  
  Represents a connection to a **data source**.  
  Examples:  
  - Table, query, or stored procedure (SQL databases)  
  - XML file  
  - RSS feed  
  - Any other external source  
  **Note**: Data providers are defined at **presentation level** and are available to all elements. You can create a new data provider by clicking the button in the drop-down box.  
  *(See "Working with data providers" for more details.)*

- **Column**  
  The **field/column** from the data provider that delivers the content to your element.

- **Content Type**  
  Defines **how the data** should be interpreted by the element (e.g., as text, image path, number).

- **Row**  
  The **record/row** of the data provider that supplies the content for the element.

---

### Remarks

- **Applicability**: Not all properties are applicable to every element. Some elements (like text elements) expect **text content**, while others (like image elements) expect **file paths to images**.
- **Dynamic Content**:  
  - When connected to a data provider, **manual content settings** of the element are **disabled**.
  - The element content is always controlled by **real-time data** from the data source.
- **Row Limitation**:  
  If the data source has fewer rows than specified in the **Row** property, **no content** will be displayed.
- **Data Scrolling**:  
  When **data scrolling** is enabled, the **Row** property combined with the **Scroll step** property controls the scroll behavior.
- **Playlists**:  
  Most elements support **playlists**. If the database field returns a playlist (multiple items), the system will automatically cycle through them.
