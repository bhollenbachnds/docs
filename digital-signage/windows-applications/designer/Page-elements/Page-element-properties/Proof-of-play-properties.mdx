The **Proof of Play** properties allow you to **log detailed information** about the playback of specific elements in your presentation. This log can be used, for example, to **demonstrate to advertisers** that their content has been shown, including when, where, and for how long.

### Proof of Play

**Log Element Statistics Info**  
When this option is enabled, the PADS4 Viewer will log detailed information each time the element is played. This information is automatically sent to the **PADS4 Server** for central collection and storage.

### Remarks

- The playback information is stored in a **dedicated proof of play database** on the **PADS4 Server PC**.
- This database can be accessed and reviewed using:
  - **PADS4 Agent**, which also allows exporting the log to XML for further analysis (e.g., in Microsoft Excel).
  - **PADS4 Software Development Kit (SDK)** for creating custom tools to process and analyze the logged data.

### Important

If you enable **Proof of Play** logging, it is essential to establish a **procedure to regularly manage and clean up** the proof of play database(s).  
Without proper maintenance, the database can **grow indefinitely**, eventually consuming all available disk space, as **automatic deletion of old records is not performed by the system**.
