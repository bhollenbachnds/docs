These properties define the **default container size** for a web page element within the presentation, ensuring consistency in how web content is displayed.

## **Web Browser Container**  

### **Purpose**  
When cropping a web page (displaying only a portion of it), **scaling issues** may arise if the web page adjusts its content dynamically based on the container size. To **prevent unexpected resizing**, a fixed **web browser container size** can be set.  

This ensures that the web page loads with a **consistent size**, and only the defined **cropped section** is displayed.

## **Container Size Settings**  

### **Enable Fixed Size**  
- Enables the **fixed mode** for the web browser container, using the specified dimensions.  

### **Width**  
- Defines the **width** of the container in **pixels**.  

### **Height**  
- Defines the **height** of the container in **pixels**.

## **Key Considerations**  

- If the **fixed size** is **not enabled**, the web page may resize dynamically, which could **alter the positioning** of the cropped content.  
- Setting a **fixed width and height** ensures that the page loads at the specified size, maintaining a **consistent layout** even when cropped.  
- If the **container size is smaller than the cropped area**, **content may be cut off**. Ensure the fixed size is large enough to accommodate the cropped section.
