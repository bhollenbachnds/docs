These properties control how often the content of a **web page element** is refreshed during playback.  

---

## **Refresh Content Options**  

### **Do Not Refresh the Web Page**  
- The web page **loads once** and remains static.  
- No automatic updates occur unless the presentation reloads.  

### **Refresh Content Every X Seconds**  
- The web page is **reloaded at regular intervals** (in seconds).  
- Helps keep dynamic content up-to-date.  

---

## **Key Considerations**  

- If **Screenshot Mode** is enabled, **content will not refresh** at all.  
- Refreshing a web page resets all **running processes** (e.g., videos, animations).  
- **Frequent refreshing** may cause **performance issues**, especially if the site has memory leaks.  

---

## **Important Warning**  
- Some websites contain **elements that cause memory leaks**.  
- Frequent reloading may **worsen the issue**, leading to **instability** during playback.  
- **Net Display Systems is not responsible** for third-party web content affecting performance.

Setting an **appropriate refresh interval** ensures that the web page updates **without unnecessary performance loss**.
