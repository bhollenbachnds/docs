Video streams are used in **entertainment and communication systems** to manage streaming media servers.

## **Playlist URL Specification**  
1. Select **"Video from File"** from the content type dropdown.  
2. Enter the **stream URL** where the stream is located.  
   - Example: `RTSP://<server>/example.mp4`  
   - Example: `RTSP://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:554`  
3. Click **"..."** next to the URL field to open the **URL Editor**, which assists in structuring the correct URL format.

## **Video Display Delay**  
- **Streaming can introduce a delay** due to buffering.  
- To reduce buffering, **increase the speed ratio to 400%**, which **bypasses the buffer**.  
- **Side effect:** This may cause video **stuttering** if the network connection is **unstable**.

## **Multicast vs. Unicast**  

### **Multicast**  
- **Sends one stream to multiple clients** instead of creating separate streams for each viewer.  
- **Reduces server/network load** by avoiding duplicate data transmission.  
- **Best for large-scale streaming environments**.  

### **Unicast**  
- **Each viewer receives an independent copy** of the stream.  
- **Uses more bandwidth** than multicast.  
- **Best for personalized or private streaming**.  

---

## **Considerations for Streaming**  
- **Streaming consumes more bandwidth** than playing locally stored videos.  
- **Multicasting** can help reduce network usage (consult your **network administrator** for details).  
- If the **network connection fails**, the stream **will stop playing**.

### **Performance Optimization Tip**  
- **To reduce playback delay**, set the **speed ratio to 400%**.  
- **Possible side effect:** If the connection is **unstable**, the video may **stutter**.
