## **Speed Ratio**  

### **Speed Adjustment**  
- Manually enter a **speed ratio** (as a percentage) or select a **predefined speed setting**.  
- **100% = Normal Speed**  
- **Higher than 100% = Faster Playback**  
- **Lower than 100% = Slower Playback**  

---

### **Use Case Example**  
- If your **video duration** is longer than the page duration, **increase the speed** to ensure it fits.  
- If you need **slow-motion effects**, reduce the speed below **100%**.

### **Tip for Synchronization**  
Adjust the **speed ratio** to match the **duration of your page**, ensuring smooth **transitions and alignment** with other content.
