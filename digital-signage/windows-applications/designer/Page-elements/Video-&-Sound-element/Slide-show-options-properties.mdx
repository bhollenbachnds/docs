These properties control whether videos **continue playing** or **restart** when a presentation page is revisited.

## **Slide Show Options**  

### **Restart Video from Last Position**  
- **Enabled**:  
  - Saves the **current playback position** when switching pages.  
  - When the page is **revisited**, the video resumes from the last position.  
- **Disabled**:  
  - The video **restarts from the beginning** every time the page is loaded.

---

### **Use Case Example**  
- If a **playlist of commercials** is playing, enabling this option ensures that **all videos in the playlist** are eventually shown, rather than restarting the first video every time the page reloads.

### **Tip for Continuous Playback**  
Enable **Restart Video from Last Position** to maintain **seamless media playback** across multiple slides.
