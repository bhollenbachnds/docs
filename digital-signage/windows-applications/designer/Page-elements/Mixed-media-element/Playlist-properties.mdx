These properties define **the media items (images, videos, streams)** that will be displayed in your Mixed Media element. You can create a **single item display** or a **playlist** that runs media files sequentially.

### **Managing the Playlist**  

- **Add**, **edit**, **reorder**, or **remove** items in your playlist.
- Playlist items can be managed in **detailed view** or **list view**.
- **Navigation buttons** at the bottom of the playlist window allow you to move through the list.
- **Total Duration** displays the cumulative duration of all playlist items.

> **Important:**  
> For in-depth guidance on managing playlists, see **Working with Play Lists**.

### **Properties of Each Playlist Item**

| **Property**               | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Media from URL**         | Contains the **URL** linking to the media source.                                                 |

### **Key Remarks**

- **Only references** to media files are included, **not** the media itself. This allows **automatic updates** during playback if the source file changes.
- **Play List properties** are **disabled** when the element is linked to a **data source**. In such cases, media content is controlled by **real-time data**.
- **Separators** are a useful way to **insert pauses** without media between items in a sequence.
