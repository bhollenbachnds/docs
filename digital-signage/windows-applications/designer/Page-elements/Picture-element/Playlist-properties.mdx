## **Picture Playlist Item Properties**

### **Type**  
Defines the **source** of the image. Possible options:

| **Option**                      | **Description** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Picture from Content Library** | Reference to an existing **picture file in the PADS4 content library** (recommended). Automatically **synchronized** across all Viewers. |
| **Picture from File** | Reference to an **image stored outside the content library**. Not synchronized automatically, so you must manually handle file distribution. |
| **Base64 String** | Used when the image **data is stored in a text-based format (Base64 string)** inside a data provider. **Example:** `"data:image/png;base64,..."` |
| **Separator** | No imageâ€”used to **create a pause** in the playlist. |

### **Important Notes**
- **Only references** to images are stored in the presentation, **not the images themselves**.

- **Playlist properties are disabled** if the element is connected to a **data source**.  
  - In this case, **image content is determined in real time** by the data source.
