### **Text-Based Playlist Item Properties**  

| **Option**  | **Description**  |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Text**  | Static text directly entered into the element. |
| **Text from Content Library**  | Uses a stored text file from the PADS4 **Content Library** (recommended). |
| **Text from File**  | References an external text file outside the Content Library. **Not synchronized automatically**â€”requires manual distribution. |
| **No Text**  | Inserts a blank entry, creating a pause in the playlist. |

### **Remarks**  
- **Multi-line text:** Use the **[Enter] key** to separate lines. Text wrapping in the editor **does not automatically mean** a multi-line display.  
- **Plain text files:** The **Data Source Text Conversion** settings determine how multi-line text is handled.  
- **Supported Formats:** The Rich Text element can read **Plain Text (TXT), Rich Text Format (RTF), and HTML**.  
- **File References Only:** If using external text files, only **references** are stored. If the text file is updated, the **latest version** will be used during playback.  
- **Data-Driven Content:** When linked to a **data source**, the playlist properties become **disabled**, as real-time data determines content dynamically.
