#### **Managing the Playlist**  
- Add, edit, reorder, or remove items from the playlist.  
- Navigate through items using the **navigation buttons** at the bottom.  
- The **total duration** of all playlist items is displayed.

### **Presentation in Page Playlist Item**  

#### **Type**  
Defines the **source** of the included presentation:  

| **Option** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **PADS4 Presentation from Content Library** | References a presentation stored in the **PADS4 content library** (recommended). Content library items are automatically **synchronized** across all PCs in your system. |
| **PADS4 Presentation from File** | References a presentation stored **outside** the content library. These files are **not synchronized** automatically, and you must manually distribute them. |
| **No PADS4 Presentation** | No presentation is includedâ€”this option is used to create a **pause** in the playlist. |

#### **Content**  
Contains the **file reference** for the selected presentation type. You can:  
- Browse the **Content Library** or your file system.  
- If using "PADS4 Presentation from File," specify the **full file path**.  

#### **Duration**  
Defines how long (in **seconds**) the selected presentation or pause will be displayed.

#### **Clip Presentation**  
- **If enabled**, only a portion of the presentation will be played based on the selected page range.  
- **First Page:** The first page to be displayed.  
- **Last Page:** The last page to be displayed.

### **Remarks**  
- **Only references** to presentation files are stored in the **container presentation**â€”not the actual files. If the referenced presentation is updated, the latest version will be used automatically during playback.  
- **Playlist properties will be disabled** when the element is connected to a **data source**. In this case, content is determined by real-time data.  
- **In PADS4 Designer**, data providers inside the **Presentation in Page** element are **not loaded** for performance reasons.
