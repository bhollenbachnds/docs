These properties define how the background of the presentation element will appear.

#### **Background Color**  

- **Use Background Color**  
  If enabled, the specified color will be used as the background when no presentations are displayed. If presentations are displayed, their background colors will take precedence.

- **Color**  
  Click the drop-down button to choose a background color. You can select:
  - A solid color  
  - A gradient with two or three colors  
  - A texture or pattern  

  *(See "Using the Color Picker" for a full description of options.)*  

- **No Background Color**  
  Selecting this option makes the background completely transparent for both the presentation element and any displayed presentations.  

#### **Remarks**  

- When "No Background Color" is selected, the background of the page where the presentation element is placed will always be visible, even when presentations are playing.  
- If a presentation has its own background color, enabling **No Background Color** will override it.  

#### **Tip**  

For a partially transparent effect, set the **Color** property to a semi-transparent value. This allows the background to remain visible when no presentation is playing, while still showing the background colors of the presentations when they are displayed.
