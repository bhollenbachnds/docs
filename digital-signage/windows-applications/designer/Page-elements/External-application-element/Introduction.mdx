External application elements are used to **start and embed other applications** during the playback of your presentation.

This element provides various options to identify, start, and stop external applications. It can also be connected to an **external data source** to dynamically determine which application to launch at runtime.

> **Note**: The External Application element **replaces** the Plug-in element from earlier PADS versions.
