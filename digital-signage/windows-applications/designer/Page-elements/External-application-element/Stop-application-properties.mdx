### **Stop Application Options**

| Option                                      | Description                                                                                   |

| **When switching to another page**          | Automatically stop the external application **when moving to the next page** in the presentation. |
| **When closing the presentation**           | Automatically stop the external application **when the presentation ends**.                      |
| **Never stop this application**             | The application **will not** be stopped automatically. This is only recommended when combined with **"Do not start this application when already running"** to avoid restarting it repeatedly. |

### **Remarks & Important Notes**

- **Stopping Mechanism**:  
  PADS4 will **kill** the running process of the external application to stop it.  
  However, **any child processes** or additional processes **started by that application will NOT be stopped automatically**. You will need to stop those manually if required.
  
- **System Performance Warning**:  
  >  **Important**: **Always ensure** that external applications are stopped properly.  
  Failure to do so can cause **memory leaks**, performance degradation, or **system instability** over time.

- **Recommended Usage**:  
  - If you set **"Never stop this application"**, ensure that:
    - The app is properly managed elsewhere.
    - You are also using **"Do not start this application when already running"** to avoid multiple instances.
