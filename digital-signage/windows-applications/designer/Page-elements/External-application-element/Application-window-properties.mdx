These properties allow you to **automatically detect** and **embed** the window of an external application into your presentation.

---

### **Application Window**

**Show the window inside this Element Boundary**  
When enabled, the system will attempt to detect and embed the window of the external application inside the boundaries of the External Application element. If successful, the application window will automatically resize to fit the element (if supported by the application) and be displayed as part of the presentation.

---

### **Window Detection Options**

- **Auto window search**  
  The system automatically attempts to detect the application's window using its **process identification settings**.

- **Search window title**  
  Instead of using automatic detection, you can search for a window based on its **title text**.

- **Window Title**  
  Enter the **exact title text** displayed in the application's title bar to identify the correct window.

- **Search for substring**  
  If enabled, the system will search for windows where the title contains the **specified text as a substring**, rather than requiring an exact match.

### **Remarks**

- **Embedding the application window** inside the element boundary has several advantages:
  - The external application's content will **automatically resize** (if supported).
  - Prevents the application window from appearing **behind** the presentation.
  - Ensures a **seamless integration** of external content within your layout.
