These properties determine how your element **handles multi-line text** when connected to an **external data source**.  

---

## **Text Handling Options**  

### **Split Multi-Line Text into Play List Items**  
- **Enabled** – Each **line of text** from the data source is treated as a **separate play list item**, allowing for **alternating display**.  
- **Disabled** – The **entire text value** is treated as **one single play list item**, displaying all lines together.  

---

## **How It Works**  
If a **multi-line text value** is received from a **data source**, this setting controls whether:  
1. **Each line is displayed separately** (like a scrolling news ticker or rotating announcements).  
2. **All lines are displayed together** in one text block.  

---

## **Example Usage**  

### **Scenario 1: Flight Announcements (Enabled)**  
**Data Source Input:**  
```
Boarding  
Einsteigen
```
- **With Splitting Enabled:** Each word appears **individually** in the playlist (e.g., "Boarding" → "Einsteigen").  
- **With Splitting Disabled:** Both lines are displayed **together** in a single text block.  

---

### **Scenario 2: Image Playlist (Enabled)**  
**Data Source Input:**  
```
c:\folder\image1.jpg  
c:\folder\image2.jpg  
```
- **Without Splitting:** The image element **cannot read** the entire input as a valid path.  
- **With Splitting:** The element **processes each line separately**, allowing a **playlist of images** to display in sequence.  

---

## **Key Notes**  
- The **separator between text lines** is the **carriage return line feed character** (`<CR> <LF>`).  
- This feature is useful when working with **lists of images, messages, or real-time data feeds**.  
- Works in combination with **playlist options** to define how items are displayed.
