The **RS-232 communication element** allows you to send **RS-232 commands** from your presentation to control external devices, such as displays, projectors, or other serially controlled equipment. These commands can adjust brightness, change input channels, or toggle power states.  

For proper usage, consult the **RS-232 documentation** of your external device to determine supported commands and configurations.  

Since the RS-232 communication element **does not require a visual presence**, it is usually set to **invisible** in presentations. However, it can be connected to an **external data source** to determine, in real-time, which commands should be sent.

## **Properties Overview**  

| **Property Section** | **Description** |
|---------------------|---------------|
| **Alternate Options** | Defines how the element will switch between play list items. |
| **Background Color** | Sets the background color of the element. |
| **Border** | Adjusts the border color, width, and style of the element. |
| **Data Provider** | Connects the element to an external **data source** for real-time command updates. |
| **Data Scrolling** | Determines whether and how the element scrolls through real-time data. |
| **Default Duration** | Specifies the default duration for **play list** items. |
| **Default Transition Effect** | Sets the **transition effect** when content updates. |
| **Flip** | Allows **horizontal or vertical flipping** of content. |
| **Font** | Defines the font settings for **text-based** RS-232 command displays. |
| **Identification** | Assigns a unique name to identify the element within the page. |
| **Play List** | Defines a **sequence of RS-232 commands** to be sent. |
| **Play List Options** | Determines how the items in the play list are executed. |
| **Port Settings** | Defines the **RS-232 port settings**, including baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits. |
| **Position** | Determines the position of the element within the page. |
| **Proof of Play** | Logs playback data for **reporting and verification** purposes. |
| **Property Bindings** | Binds specific element properties to an external data source. |
| **Reflection** | Enables a **reflection effect** on the element. |
| **Rotation** | Allows you to **rotate** the element at a certain angle. |
| **Rules** | Defines **element rules** for dynamic behavior. |
| **Shadow** | Adds a shadow effect to the element. |
| **Size** | Sets the width and height of the element. |
| **Text Alignment** | Adjusts the **horizontal and vertical** alignment of text-based commands. |
| **Transparency** | Defines the transparency level of the element. |
| **Visibility** | Controls whether the element is visible during playback. |

### **Remarks**  
- **Ensure the correct RS-232 settings** (baud rate, parity, data bits, stop bits) match the specifications of your **external device**.  
- **RS-232 elements typically remain invisible**, as they serve a functional role rather than a visual one.  
- If connected to an **external data source**, the commands can change dynamically in real time.  
- **Proof of Play logging** can be useful for monitoring when and where RS-232 commands were executed.
