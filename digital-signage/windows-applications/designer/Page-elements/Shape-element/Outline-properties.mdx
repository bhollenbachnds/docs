## **Outline Settings**  

### **Show**  
- **Enable or disable** the outline (border) around the shape.  

### **Outline Color**

### **Outline Width**  
- Set the **thickness of the outline** in pixels.

## **Remarks**

- Using a **gradient or pattern** for the outline can add **visual depth** to the shape.
