Shape elements are used to display **rectangles, squares, circles**, or other **predefined shapes**.  

Shapes can be **angled, filled with solid colors, gradients, or patterns**, and customized with various **visual effects**.  

They can also be **dynamically updated** based on an **external data source** to control **visibility and appearance in real-time**.
