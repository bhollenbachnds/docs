These properties define **how the chart is positioned and sized** within the boundaries of its chart element. You can choose to let the system handle this automatically or specify exact measurements manually for custom layouts.

## **Manual Position and Size Properties**

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Left**     | The **horizontal start position** of the chart, as a **percentage of the total width** of the chart element. |
| **Top**      | The **vertical start position** of the chart, as a **percentage of the total height** of the chart element. |
| **Width**    | The **width** of the chart, as a **percentage of the total width** of the chart element.                   |

## **Remarks**
- **Automatic mode** is ideal when you want the system to optimize chart layout within the available space.
- **Manual mode** gives full control, which is useful when you need precise placement for specific design requirements.
- The **percentage-based system** ensures that resizing the overall chart element will adjust the chart proportionally.
