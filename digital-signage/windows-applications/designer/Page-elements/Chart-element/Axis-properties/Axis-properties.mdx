These properties determine the **layout, appearance, and visibility** of the axis in general, and can be set for **X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis** individually.

## **X-Axis Properties**

| **Property**                 | **Description**                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Title**                    | The text label displayed along the axis, describing its purpose (e.g., "Sales", "Time", "Categories").  |
| **Color**                    | Sets the color of the axis line for visual customization.                                                |
| **Show X-Axis**              | Toggles the visibility of the X-axis on or off.                                                          |
| **Show Secondary X-Axis**    | Toggles a second X-axis on the opposite side of the chart on or off, useful for complex data comparisons.|
| **Show X-Axis Margins**      | When enabled, adds margins (padding) between the minimum/maximum data values and the axis start/end.    |

## **Remarks**
- **All of these properties** are also available for the **Y-axis and Z-axis**, allowing for consistent and flexible customization of all axes in the chart.
- **Secondary axes** are especially useful for charts that need to compare datasets with different scales.
- **Axis margins** can improve readability by preventing data points from touching the edges of the chart.
