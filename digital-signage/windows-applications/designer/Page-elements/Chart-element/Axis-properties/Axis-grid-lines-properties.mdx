|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Show Major Grid Lines**    | Enables or disables the display of major grid lines, typically aligned with key axis values.                             |
| **Show Minor Grid Lines**    | Enables or disables the display of minor grid lines, typically used to indicate intervals between major grid lines.      |
| **Color**                    | Sets the color of the grid lines. You can choose a solid color, gradient, texture, or pattern. Refer to **Using the Color Picker** for more options. |
| **Width**                    | Specifies the thickness of the grid lines in pixels, allowing you to adjust their visual prominence.                    |
| **Interval**                 | Defines the distance (in pixels) between consecutive grid lines, allowing for precise control of spacing.               |

## **Remarks**
- **All properties described above** for the **X-axis** are equally applicable to the **Y-axis and Z-axis**.
- **Major grid lines** help emphasize significant values or categories, while **minor grid lines** assist with detailed analysis and finer subdivisions.
- Customizing **color, width, and interval** allows you to adjust the visibility and design of grid lines to fit the visual style of your presentation.
