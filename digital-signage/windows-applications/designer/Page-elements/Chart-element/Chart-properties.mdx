## **Properties Overview**

| **Property**                     | **Description**                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Title**                        | The text displayed above the chart. Use the **alignment buttons** to set the horizontal alignment of the title. |
| **Font**                         | Displays the current **font and style** for the chart title. Click the button next to the text box to open the **font dialog box** and make adjustments. |
| **Color**                        | Sets the **text color** of the chart title.                                                               |
| **2D Chart**                     | Displays the real-time data using a **two-dimensional (2D)** chart format.                                 |
| **3D Chart**                     | Displays the real-time data using a **three-dimensional (3D)** chart format for a more dynamic visual effect. |
| **Light Source**                 | Sets the **lighting effect** applied to the 3D chart, affecting shadows and highlights.                    |
| **Chart Background Color**       | Selects the **background color** of the chart area. Options include **solid color, gradient, texture, or pattern**. See *Using the color picker* for more details. |
| **Chart Depth**                  | Defines the **depth** of the 3D chart, adjusting the viewing angle and visual perception of depth.         |
| **Horizontal Rotation**          | Controls the **rotation of the 3D chart around the X and Y axes**, altering its horizontal viewing angle.  |
| **Vertical Rotation**            | Controls the **rotation of the 3D chart around the X and Z axes**, adjusting its vertical tilt.            |
| **Perspective View**             | Enables perspective mode to adjust how the 3D chart is angled in relation to the viewer.                   |
| **Angle**                        | Sets the **perspective angle (in degrees)** for the 3D chart, affecting how extreme or mild the perspective is. |

## **Remarks**
- **2D and 3D chart modes** allow for flexible visualization depending on your presentation needs.
- Adjusting **rotation and perspective** properties can give depth and dynamic visualization to the 3D chart.
- **Color and font options** help align the chart's appearance with the overall presentation design.
- **Light source settings** enhance the realism of 3D charts by simulating lighting effects.
