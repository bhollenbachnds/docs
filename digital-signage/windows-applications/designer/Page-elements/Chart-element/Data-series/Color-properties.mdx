The **Color properties** in the **Data Series Wizard** define how the data in your series will be visually colored in the chart. You can choose **automatic colors**, **custom series colors**, or even **individual colors per data point**.

## **Colors**

| **Option**                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Predefined Color by Series**    | The system **automatically assigns a color** to your series. When multiple data series are present, each will get a **different color automatically** to ensure distinction.              |
| **Custom Color by Series**        | **Manually define** the color for your entire series. You need to **assign different colors for each series** yourself to maintain visual clarity.                                        |
| **Custom Color by Datapoint**     | Assign **individual colors to each data point** within the series. This allows for more detailed color control, useful for emphasizing specific data items or for color coding.            |
