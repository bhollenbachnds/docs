The **Chart Type properties** in the **Data Series Wizard** define **how your data series will be visually represented** in the chart. These properties allow you to select the **type of chart**, **name the series**, control its **visibility**, and **assign it to a secondary axis** when needed.

| **Chart Type**                 | Select the **chart type** for displaying your data series. Examples include **bar, line, pie, area**, etc.       |
|                               | As you choose a type, a **preview window** shows a visual example of the chart to help you decide.              |
| **Visible Serie**              | Toggle this option **on/off** to show or hide the data series in the final chart.                                |
| **Serie Name**                 | Enter a **unique name** to identify the data series in the **list of series** within the chart configuration.   |
| **Serie Legend Title**         | Add a **descriptive title** for the series to be shown in the **chart legend**.                                  |
| **Add serie to secondary Y-Axis** | Assign this series to the **secondary Y-axis**, useful when comparing data series with different scales.        |
|                               | **Note:** This option is only available if the general chart setting **"Show Secondary Y-Axis"** is enabled.    |

## **Key Notes**
- **Choosing the correct chart type** is crucial for clear and effective data visualization.
- **Secondary Y-Axis** helps in visualizing datasets that have significantly different value ranges on the same chart.
- You can manage **visibility** of series dynamically, which is helpful when you want to compare only certain data series without removing others.
- **Legend titles** make charts easier to understand for viewers, especially when multiple series are displayed.
