Data series define **what data is displayed** in the chart and **how it is represented**. Each data series connects to a data source (such as a database or XML file) and contains the settings that control **the type of chart**, **style**, **labels**, **colors**, and **other display options**.

Although most charts work with a **single data series**, you can add **multiple data series** to display different sets of data in the same chart.
