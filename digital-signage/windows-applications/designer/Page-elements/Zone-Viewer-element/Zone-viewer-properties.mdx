The **Zone Viewer Properties** define how the **Zone Viewer** is recognized within the **PADS4 system**. During playback, the zone viewer will display **scheduled presentations** assigned to its destination.

## **Identification Methods**  

### **Manual Zone Viewer Name**  
- Enter a **Viewer Name** that the **PADS4 system** will use to identify the **Zone Viewer**.  
- This name allows **targeted scheduling** for specific zones.  

### **Zone Viewer Name Provided by Data Provider**  
- The **Viewer Name** can be dynamically assigned by a **data provider**.  
- This enables **real-time assignment** of content based on external data.

## **Data Provider Integration**  

### **Data Provider**  
- Represents a **connection to an external data source** such as:  
  - **Database table, query, or stored procedure**  
  - **XML file or RSS feed**  
  - **Other supported dynamic content sources**  
- Data providers are defined at the **presentation level**, making them available to all elements.  

### **Column Selection**  
- Choose a **specific column** from the **data provider** to bind to the Zone Viewer.  

### **Row Selection**  
- Define the **specific row** from the data provider that will be linked to the Zone Viewer.

## **Key Considerations**  

- **Shared Viewer Names** – Unlike regular **Viewers**, the **Zone Viewer Name** does **not** have to be **unique**.  
- **Multiple Displays** – If the same **Zone Viewer Name** is used in multiple places, all instances will **display the same scheduled content**.  
- **Group Scheduling** – When a **Zone Viewer** is scheduled within a **Viewer Group**, all Viewers in that group will display the **same content** for the Zone.
