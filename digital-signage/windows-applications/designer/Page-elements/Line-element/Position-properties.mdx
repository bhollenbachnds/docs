These properties determine the **exact placement and length** of the line within your page. You can define both the **starting and ending points** of the line using pixel values.

### **Position Properties Overview**  

| **Property** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Left** | The **horizontal position** (in pixels) of the **leftmost point** of the line. |
| **Right** | The **horizontal position** (in pixels) of the **rightmost point** of the line. |
| **Top** | The **vertical position** (in pixels) of the **topmost point** of the line. |
| **Bottom** | The **vertical position** (in pixels) of the **bottommost point** of the line. |

### **Key Notes**  

- **Precise Placement**: These properties allow you to **manually set** or **fine-tune** the position and length of your line.
- **Override Grid**: If **Snap to Grid** is enabled, these properties can still be used to position lines **off-grid** for precise alignment.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**:  
  - Position values are **automatically updated** when you:  
    - **Move** the line using the mouse or arrow keys.  
    - **Paste** the line element into a new location.  
    - Use **formatting functions** (e.g., align, size adjustments).

### **Practical Tips**  

- **Manual Fine-tuning**: Use these fields for **pixel-perfect** adjustments that cannot be easily achieved by dragging.
- **Consistency**: Ensuring consistent line lengths or alignment across different pages can be achieved by **copying** and **reusing** exact position values.
- **Custom Angles**: By adjusting all four properties, you can create lines at **any angle**, not just horizontal or vertical.
