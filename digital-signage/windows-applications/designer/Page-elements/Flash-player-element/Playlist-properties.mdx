- **Edit** existing play list items.
- **Reorder** items using sequence adjustment tools.
- **Remove** items from the list if needed.
- Use **navigation buttons** (at the bottom of the dialog) to move through play list items.
- The **total duration** shows the combined playback time of all listed items.

### **Flash Play List Item Properties**

#### **Type**  
Defines the **source** of the Flash file. Options include:

| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Flash from Content Library** | Reference to a Flash file stored in the **PADS4 content library** (recommended). Automatically synchronized across all PADS4 systems. References are **relative** and remain valid even if the library is moved. |
| **Flash from File**            | Reference to a Flash file stored **outside the content library**. **Not synchronized**—you must manage distribution yourself. References are **absolute** and must be valid on playback PCs.                 |
| **No Flash**                  | No Flash file included. Used to create a **pause** in the play list.                                                                                                    |

---

#### **Content**  
Specifies the **Flash file path**, depending on the selected **Type**.  
- Use the **browse button** to select files from the **Content Library** or local file system.  
- If **Flash from File** is selected, provide the **full file path**.

---

#### **Duration**  
Sets the **duration (in seconds)** for which the Flash content will be displayed.  
- If **No Flash** is selected, this defines the length of the pause.

---

### **Remarks**
- Only **references** to Flash files are stored in your presentation, **not the actual files**.  
- If the Flash file is updated, the **latest version** will be used during playback.
- **Play list properties are disabled** when the element is connected to a **data provider** — in that case, content is dynamically determined by real-time data.
