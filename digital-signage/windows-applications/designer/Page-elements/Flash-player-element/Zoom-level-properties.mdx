### **Zoom Level**

#### **Zoom**
- Adjust the **zoom level** of the Flash content.
- You can **manually enter a percentage** or use the **slider** to control the zoom.
- This allows you to **scale** the Flash content to fit or highlight specific parts of the content.

#### **Offset**
- The **Offset** settings enable you to **clip** and position the Flash content within the player element.
- **Left**: Defines the horizontal offset (in pixels) — moves the content left or right inside the element.
- **Top**: Defines the vertical offset (in pixels) — moves the content up or down inside the element.
- These offsets determine **which part** of the Flash content will be shown, starting from the specified position.

### **Usage Tip**
- **Zoom** and **Offset** can be combined to **focus** on specific areas of the Flash content or to adjust how it fits inside the element's frame.
