The **Play List Properties** define the **PowerPoint files** that will be displayed within your PowerPoint element. You can **add multiple presentations**, edit them, change their sequence, or remove them from the list.

---

## **Managing the Play List**
- You can **add**, **edit**, **reorder**, or **remove** PowerPoint presentations.
- Navigation buttons allow you to **browse through the list**.
- The **total duration** shows the combined display time of all presentations.
- The properties of a playlist item depend on the **type of the PowerPoint element**.

### **PowerPoint Playlist Item**
Each item in the play list can originate from **different sources**, as described below:

| **Option**                  | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|----------------|
| **PowerPoint from Content Library** | The PowerPoint file is stored in the **PADS4 Content Library** (recommended). Files in the Content Library are **automatically synchronized** between all PCs. |
| **PowerPoint from File**     | The file is **stored locally** outside the PADS4 Content Library. These files are **not automatically synchronized**, so you must manually distribute them. |
| **Separator**               | Creates a **pause** in the playlist. No PowerPoint presentation is displayed during this interval. |

---

## **PowerPoint File Details**
| **Property** | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Content** | Stores the reference to the PowerPoint file. You can **browse** the Content Library or your file system. If using a local file, the full **file path** must be specified. |
| **Duration** | Defines **how long (in seconds)** each PowerPoint presentation will be displayed. If set to `0`, the slides will follow the default PowerPoint timing. |
| **Effect**   | Specifies the **incoming transition effect** and its **duration (in seconds)**. |

---

## **Important Notes**
- Only **references** to PowerPoint files are stored, **not the actual files**.
- If the **original PowerPoint file is updated**, the latest version will be used during playback.
- The **Play List properties are disabled** if the element is connected to a **data source**â€”in that case, content is determined by real-time data.
- **PowerPoint presentations always appear in the foreground** and cannot be overlapped by other elements.
