Before viewing or managing scheduled presentations, you must first **select a Destination**. In PADS4, a *Destination* refers to a **Viewer** (a digital signage device) or a **Viewer Group** (a collection of Viewers). These devices are managed centrally by the PADS4 system.

PADS4 Scheduler provides multiple ways to select a Destination, depending on your preference or setup.

## Selecting a Destination from the Tree View

1. In the **main window**, locate the **Destinations tree view** on the left-hand pane.  
2. Click on a **Viewer** or **Viewer Group** to select it.  
   - Use the arrow symbols to expand grouped items if necessary.  
3. Once selected, the schedule views on the right will automatically update to reflect the chosen Destination.

> **Note:** The tree view is typically auto-populated with Viewers defined in your PADS4 system. If your user account has limited permissions, only Viewers youâ€™re authorized to access will appear.
