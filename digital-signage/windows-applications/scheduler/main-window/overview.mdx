Once you have started the **PADS4 Scheduler** application, connected to your **PADS4 Server**, and successfully logged in, you will be presented with the **main interface**, also known as the **overview window**.

This is the central hub where you can manage schedules, select destinations, browse dates, and control the display of presentations.
