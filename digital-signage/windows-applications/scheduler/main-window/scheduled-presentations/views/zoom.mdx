The **Zoom** functionality in PADS4 Scheduler allows you to adjust the level of detail displayed in the **Calendar View**. This is especially useful when working with dense schedules or reviewing long-duration presentations.

> **Note:** Not all Calendar modes support zooming. Zoom functionality is available in **Day**, **Work Week**, **Week**, and **Timeline** views, but **not in Month view**.

## Zoom In

To increase the zoom level (view finer time details):

1. Go to the **View** tab in the ribbon bar.  
2. In the **Zoom** group, click **Zoom In**.

This narrows the time scale, showing smaller intervals (e.g., 15-minute blocks instead of 30-minute blocks).

## Zoom Out

To decrease the zoom level (view a broader time overview):

1. Go to the **View** tab in the ribbon bar.  
2. In the **Zoom** group, click **Zoom Out**.

This expands the view, displaying more hours or days at once.

## Select a Specific Zoom Level

To jump directly to a predefined zoom level:

1. In the **Zoom** group of the **View** tab, click **Zoom Level**.  
2. A dropdown menu will appear with available levels.  
3. Click on the desired zoom level to apply it.
