When enabled in the **PADS4 Server settings**, content synchronization ensures that the local **Content Library** on your PADS4 Scheduler remains in sync with the central server. This applies to all media types, including PADS4 presentations, video files, images, and other supported content.

PADS4 supports **two-way synchronization**: any changes made locally or on the server—such as adding, editing, or removing content—are automatically or manually synchronized across systems.

## Setting Up Content Synchronization

To configure synchronization:

1. Open the **Tools** tab in the ribbon bar.
2. In the **Synchronization** section, click **Options**.

The **Synchronization Settings** window will open.

### Configuration Options

- **Content Library Synchronization Activation**  
  Choose one of the following synchronization modes:
  - **Automatically** – Synchronization starts when a content change is detected.
  - **Manually** – Requires user-initiated synchronization.
  - **Never** – Disables synchronization entirely.

- **PADS4 Content Library Storage Folder**  
  Defines the local folder where synchronized content is stored.
  - **Automatic** is recommended if not using multiple servers or domains.

Click **OK** to apply the settings.

> **Note:**  
> If **PADS4 Server** and **PADS4 Scheduler** are installed on the same computer, be sure to select **This Computer** in the connection settings. This automatically disables synchronization since both components share the same local content.

> When multiple PADS4 applications (e.g., Scheduler, Designer) run on the same PC and connect to the same server, they share the same synchronization process.

## Starting Content Synchronization

If **Automatic** synchronization is enabled, the system will initiate synchronization when it detects changes in the content library.

If **Manual** synchronization is enabled:

1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Click **Synchronize Now** under the **Synchronization** section.

The **Synchronization Progress** window will open and display the progress of the current session.

Once synchronization is complete, the log will display:  
> *"The synchronization session has finished."*

Click **Close** to exit the window.

> If you use automatic synchronization, clicking **Synchronize Now** will either manually start the process or show its current progress.

---

## Canceling Content Synchronization

To stop an ongoing synchronization session:

1. If the **Synchronization Progress** window is open, you can simply click **Close**.
2. Alternatively, click **Cancel** in the **Tools > Synchronization** section.

> If the **Cancel** button is disabled, no synchronization process is currently running.

## Viewing Synchronization Progress and Logs

To check real-time synchronization status or review recent logs:

1. In the **Tools** tab, under **Synchronization**, click **Show Progress**.
2. The **Synchronization Progress** window will open.

### Window Breakdown

- **Synchronization Status**  
  - Top progress bar: shows overall sync progress.
  - Bottom progress bar: shows progress of the current item.
  - Once completed, only one progress bar is visible at 100%.

- **Download Progress / Log**  
  - Displays logs from the current or most recent session.
  - Click **Refresh** to update the log view with the latest information.
