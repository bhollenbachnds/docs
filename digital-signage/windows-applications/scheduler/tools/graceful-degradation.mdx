When PADS4 is initially installed, activation is completed using the **PADS4 License Wizard**. This process generates a **hardware-bound product key**, which is verified against your systemâ€™s hardware profile.

## Graceful Degradation Period: 7 Days

If **hardware changes** are detected (e.g., replacement of the network adapter or changes in system identifiers), PADS4 enters a **graceful degradation period**.

- **Duration**: 7 days
- During this time, the system **continues to function normally**
- A **warning message** is displayed during login for the following applications:
  - PADS4 Agent
  - PADS4 Messenger
  - System Management
  - Scheduler
  - Designer

> You can configure an alert within the **PADS4 Agent** to notify administrators via email when hardware changes are detected and reactivation is required.

## Reactivating the PADS4 Server

To prevent PADS4 from shutting down after the 7-day grace period, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reactivation Process:

1. **Contact your reseller** to report the hardware change and request reactivation.
   - Provide your **PADS4 product key**.
2. The reseller will contact **Net Display Systems** to verify your license and authorize reactivation.
3. You will receive an **email confirmation** once your license has been approved for reactivation.

### Reactivation via License Wizard:

1. Launch the **License Wizard** on the PADS4 Server.
2. Select the **Server** and click **Next**.
3. Review the current license details and click **Next** again.
4. In the **Select an Action** window, choose:
   - **Reactivate current installation**
5. The wizard will connect to the PADS4 License Server to verify your key.
6. Upon successful validation, the hardware profile is reset, and the degradation period ends.

> Note: An **internet connection** is required for online reactivation.

### Offline Activation:

If your server does not have internet access:
- Select **Activate installation offline** in the License Wizard
- Follow the guided instructions to complete activation manually

## Best Practices and Recommendations

- **PADS4 will stop working** after 7 days if the reactivation is not completed.
- If running on a **virtual machine**, ensure the **MAC address is fixed** to avoid unintended hardware changes.
- Avoid enabling or sharing **Bluetooth devices** on virtual machines, as this may trigger a hardware change detection.
- Use **email alerts** via the PADS4 Agent to stay informed about pending reactivation requirements.

## What Triggers a Hardware Change Detection?

PADS4 compares several hardware identifiers to the original activation data. If any of the following change, a reactivation may be required:

- Operating System
- Processor ID
- OS Installation Date
- OS Serial Number
- BIOS Serial Number and Version
- Network Adapter and MAC Address
- Windows Activation Code
