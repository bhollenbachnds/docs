When **PADS4 Scheduler** starts, it attempts to establish a connection to a configured **PADS4 Server**. The behavior of the application on startup depends on how the **connection properties** are set.

## Connecting for the First Time

If this is the **first time** you are starting PADS4 Scheduler and no connection properties have been configured:

- You will receive a **notification message** prompting you to set up the connection.
- Click **OK** to open the **PADS4 Server Connections** window.
- In this window, you can specify the required settings to connect to your PADS4 Server, including server address, port, and credentials.

Once completed and saved, the Scheduler will attempt to establish a connection.

## Manual Connection

If you've chosen to **manually manage server connections**, the main window will remain empty on startup.

To manually connect:

### Option 1: Use the Network Connection Button

1. Locate the **network connection button** in the ribbon bar.  
2. Click it to initiate a connection to the default or previously used server.

### Option 2: Use the Server Connection Split Button

1. Click the **PADS4 Server Connection Split Button** in the ribbon.  
2. A dropdown list of available server connections will appear.  
3. Hover over the server you wish to connect to, and click it.  
4. PADS4 Scheduler will attempt to connect to the selected server.

## Automatic Connection

If you've configured **automatic server connection**, PADS4 Scheduler will:

- Attempt to connect to the specified PADS4 Server **immediately on launch**
- Load the interface once the connection is successful

No additional interaction is required unless the connection fails, in which case you'll be prompted to verify or re-enter connection settings.
