## First-Time Startup or Connection Issues

> **Note:** If all configuration settings are correct, PADS4 Scheduler will automatically connect to the **PADS4 Server software** upon launch.

If you're starting the application for the **first time**, or if any configuration settings are incorrect (e.g., invalid server address or credentials), the system will display the **Connection Management window**.

This window allows you to:

- Enter the correct server address and port  
- Test the connection to the PADS4 Server  
- Save your configuration

Once successfully connected, the main application interface will be launched.
