Within the **Connection Properties**, you can define how you wish to **log on to your PADS4 Server**. These settings are located in the **Credentials tab** when adding or editing a server connection.

## Specifying Logon Details

To set your login preferences:

1. Open the **PADS4 Server Connections** window.  
2. Choose to **Add** or **Edit** a server connection.  
3. Navigate to the **Credentials** tab.

### Required Fields:

- **User Name**:  
  Enter the account name used to access the PADS4 Server.

- **Password** (optional):  
  You may leave this blank if you prefer to be prompted at each login.

### Automatic Login Option:

- Check **Automatic Login** to have the application attempt to sign you in automatically when connecting.
- When enabled, you must also enter your **Password**.

> If the automatic login fails, you will be prompted to enter your credentials manually.

## Working with Domains

> **Note:** If your PADS4 Server uses **Domains**, you may specify domain-specific logon details in the **Domain** section of the connection settings.

This is considered an **advanced configuration**, and further guidance is available in the **PADS4 Installation Manual**.

In most scenarios, leaving the **Domain setting to Automatic** will be sufficient.
