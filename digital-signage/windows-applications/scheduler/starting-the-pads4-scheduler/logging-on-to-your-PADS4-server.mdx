Once PADS4 Scheduler has successfully connected to your **PADS4 Server**, the next step is to **log on**. This step ensures you have the appropriate user permissions to access, schedule, and manage content within the system.

## Manual Logon

If you've configured **manual logon**, you will be prompted to enter your credentials each time the application starts.

### Steps to Log On Manually:

1. After launching PADS4 Scheduler and establishing a server connection, a **logon screen** will appear.  
2. Enter your **Username** and **Password**.  
3. Click the **Log On** button.

PADS4 Scheduler will attempt to complete the logon process and provide access to your workspace.

## Automatic Logon

If you've enabled **automatic logon**:

- PADS4 Scheduler will log on in the background as soon as the server connection is established.  
- You will not see the login screen unless an issue occurs (e.g., invalid credentials or connection failure).

When successful, youâ€™ll be taken directly to the main scheduling interface.
