PADS4 Scheduler supports connections to **multiple PADS4 Servers** simultaneously. This feature allows you to view and manage schedules from different servers within a single instance of the applicationâ€”ideal for environments with distributed or segmented deployments.

## Connecting to an Additional PADS4 Server

Assuming you already have one connection active (e.g., **MyPADSServer**), and another server connection has been configured (e.g., **AnotherPADSServer**) via the **Connection Properties** settings:

To establish a connection to a second server:

1. Go to the **Home** tab in the ribbon bar.
2. In the **Connections** group, click the **Connect** split button.
3. From the dropdown list, select the additional server connection (e.g., **AnotherPADSServer**).

Once connected, both server connections will appear in the **navigation pane** at the bottom-left of the interface. The newly selected server becomes the **active** server, indicated by:

- Highlighted server name in the navigation pane
- Display of the server name above the calendar
- Updated status bar information

> **Note:** Navigation panes are only shown when two or more server connections are active. If only one server is connected, the pane remains hidden.

## Viewing Schedules from Multiple Servers

You can now open **separate windows** for different PADS4 Servers and compare schedules side by side.

To do this:

- Use the **New Window** button under the **View** tab (see the *Working with Multiple Windows* section).
- Assign each window to a different **Destination** on a separate server.

This layout allows simultaneous visibility into schedules from both servers.

## Disconnecting from PADS4 Servers

To disconnect from one or more server connections:

### Disconnect a Single Server

1. Go to the **Home** tab.
2. In the **Connections** group, click the **Disconnect** split button.
3. Select the specific server connection you wish to disconnect.

This will:

- Close the selected connection
- Remove its navigation pane
- Close any windows associated with that server

### Disconnect All Servers

To close all active server connections at once:

- In the **Home** tab, under **Connections**, click **Disconnect All**.

All connected servers and associated windows will be closed.
