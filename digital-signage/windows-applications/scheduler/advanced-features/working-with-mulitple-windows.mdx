PADS4 Scheduler supports working with multiple windows, allowing users to **compare schedules across different Destinations** side by side. This feature is useful for managing complex schedules across various screens or Viewer groups.

## Creating a New Window

To open an additional scheduling window:

1. Navigate to the **View** tab in the ribbon bar.
2. In the **Window** group, click **New Window**.

A new window will open within the scheduling area, initially displaying the **same Destination** as the original window.

To change the Destination:

- Use the **Select Destination** button in the ribbon bar, or  
- Use the **Destinations tree view** in the left pane of the application.

Each window can now display the schedule of a different Destination for easy comparison.
