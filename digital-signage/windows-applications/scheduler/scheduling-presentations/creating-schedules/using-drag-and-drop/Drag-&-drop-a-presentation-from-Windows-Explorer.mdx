If youâ€™ve created presentations using **PADS4 Designer** and saved them as `.PADSX` files to your local drive or network storage, you can schedule them directly by **dragging and dropping** them into **PADS4 Scheduler**.

This feature provides a fast and intuitive way to schedule existing presentations without manually browsing for files.

## How to Drag & Drop a Presentation into Scheduler

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure both **PADS4 Scheduler** and **Windows Explorer** are open and positioned so that both windows are visible.

### Steps:

1. **Locate the presentation file**  
   - In **Windows Explorer**, navigate to the `.PADSX` file you want to schedule.

2. **Click and hold** the file with your mouse.

3. **Drag the file** over to the **PADS4 Scheduler window**.  
   - Your mouse cursor will change to indicate that a file can be dropped (usually a small document icon appears).

4. **Release the mouse button** to drop the file onto the Scheduler interface.

### What Happens Next

- The **Schedule Wizard** will launch automatically.
- The selected `.PADSX` file will already be loaded into the wizard.
- From this point forward, the scheduling process follows the same steps as a **Simple Schedule**:
  - Enter a name
  - Choose destination
  - Define display period and priority
  - (Optionally) apply recurrence
  - Click **Finish** to complete the schedule
