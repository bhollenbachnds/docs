In addition to scheduling existing presentations, **PADS4 Scheduler** also allows you to create and schedule a **new presentation on-the-fly** using the integrated PADS4 Designer. This workflow is useful when immediate content creation and deployment are needed without switching between applications.

## How to Schedule a Presentation by Creating It Directly from the Scheduler

Follow these steps to create and schedule a new presentation directly from PADS4 Scheduler:

---

### Step 1: Launch PADS4 Designer

1. In the **Scheduler toolbar**, go to the **Home** tab.  
2. In the **New Schedule** group, click **New Presentation**.

This will launch **PADS4 Designer**.

---

### Step 2: Create the Presentation

- Use PADS4 Designer to build your presentation as needed.
- Add text, media, data elements, and design it to match your display requirements.

---

### Step 3: Schedule the Presentation from Designer

1. When your presentation is ready, navigate to the **Home** tab in the Designer toolbar.  
2. In the **Scheduler Actions** group, click **Schedule Presentation**.

This opens the **Schedule Wizard** directly from within Designer.

---

### Step 4: Complete the Schedule Wizard

- In the **Identification** section, enter a **Name** for the schedule.
- Since you're creating a new presentation, the **Presentation to be Scheduled** section will be pre-filled and locked to this on-the-fly presentation.

> From this point forward, the process follows the same steps as creating a **Simple Schedule**:
> - Define destination  
> - Set display period (and optional recurrence)  
> - Select priority  
> - Finalize the schedule

---

### Step 5: Return to Scheduler

Once the schedule is complete:

1. In Designer, go to the **Home** tab again.  
2. Click **Return to Scheduler** in the **Scheduler Actions** group.

> **Note:** A prompt will appear asking if you would like to **save the presentation to a file** or **store it in the Content Library**. Saving is optional.

---

### Step 6: Verify in Scheduler

After returning to PADS4 Scheduler, you can confirm that the new schedule has been created and added to the calendar or table view.
