The **Advanced Schedule** in PADS4 Scheduler offers **complete scheduling flexibility**. This powerful schedule type allows you to:

- Schedule the **same content** to be shown on **multiple destinations**
- Define **different time periods** and **priorities** for each instance
- Build a **comprehensive timetable** that acts as a multi-destination, multi-period schedule controller

---

### Example Use Case:

You can schedule the same playlist to:

- Appear on **Viewer A** in the **morning**
- Then appear on **Viewer Group B** two days later in the **evening**
- Each with **different priority levels**

This level of control is ideal for complex signage networks with diverse content distribution requirements.
