As outlined in the *Recurrence* overview, PADS4 Scheduler allows you to define **repetitive schedules** using customizable recurrence patterns. Recurrence can be applied to **Simple**, **Playlist**, and **Advanced** schedules and ensures that content is shown repeatedly over defined intervals without needing to create duplicate schedules.

---

## Accessing the Recurrence Settings

You can apply recurrence in two ways:

- During schedule creation in the **Schedule Wizard** by clicking the **Recurrence** button.
- From the **Ribbon Bar** by selecting the **Recurrence** function (see the *Recurrence* topic for details).

Once accessed, the **Recurrence Settings** window will appear.

## Recurrence Settings Window

This window is divided into four key sections:

1. **Period**  
2. **Type**  
3. **Within One Day**  
4. **Description**  

Each is described below.

---

### 1. Period: Defining the Time Span

In this section, you set the overall **start and end conditions** of the recurrence pattern.

- **Start Date**: Specifies when the recurrence begins.
- **End Options**:
  - **By End Date**: Ends on a specific date.
  - **By Number of Occurrences**: Ends after a set number of repeats.
  - **No End Date**: Repeats indefinitely.

---

### 2. Type: Defining the Recurrence Pattern

PADS4 Scheduler offers **four recurrence types**, each with flexible configuration options:

#### **Daily**
- Repeats every *X* number of days  
- Optionally, restrict to weekdays only

#### **Weekly**
- Select specific days of the week (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri)  
- Choose the repeat interval in weeks (e.g., every 2 weeks)

#### **Monthly**
- Two configuration options:
  - **By Date**: e.g., every 15th of the month  
  - **By Pattern**: e.g., *Second Tuesday* of every 3 months  
    - Choose: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, `last`  
    - Then select: `day`, `weekday`, `weekend day`, or a specific day (e.g., Monday)

#### **Yearly**
- Similar to Monthly, with two options:
  - **By Date**: e.g., March 23rd every year  
  - **By Pattern**: e.g., *Last Friday* of April  
    - Define the ordinal, weekday, and month

---

### 3. Within One Day: Time-Based Repetition

This section defines **when during a single day** the content should be displayed:

- **From / Until**: Set the daily time window (e.g., 08:00–18:00)

You can also specify finer granularity within that window:

- **Uninterrupted**: Show continuously within the time window  
- **Several minutes per hour**  
- **Several minutes per X minutes**

> This is useful when you want content to appear only at intervals, such as 10 minutes every hour.

---

### 4. Description: Review the Recurrence Summary

The **Description** section dynamically updates as you adjust the settings. It provides a **readable summary** of the recurrence pattern for easy verification.

Example output:  
*“Occurs every Monday and Wednesday, from 08:00 to 18:00, starting on March 1st, ending after 10 occurrences.”*
