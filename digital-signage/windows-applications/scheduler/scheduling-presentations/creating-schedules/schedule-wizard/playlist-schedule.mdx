A **Playlist Schedule** allows you to schedule **multiple presentations** to be shown **sequentially** on a single destination during a defined display period. This is ideal for rotating content such as promotional videos, announcements, or mixed media content.

## How to Create a Playlist Schedule

Creating a Playlist Schedule follows a similar process to a Simple Schedule, with a few additional steps to manage the presentation list.

---

### Step 1: Start the Schedule Wizard

1. Open the **Schedule Wizard**.  
2. Click **Playlist Schedule**.

---

### Step 2: Identification

In the **Identification** section, enter a **Name** for your schedule. This name helps distinguish it from other schedules.

---

### Step 3: Add Presentations to the Playlist

In the **Presentations** section, you will define the list of presentations that make up your playlist.

Use the **toolbar** to manage presentations:

| **Icon** | **Function** |
|----------|--------------|
| 📂 | Import presentation from the **Content Library** |
| 📁 | Import presentation from a **file** |
| ✏️ | **Design and add** a new presentation using PADS4 Designer |
| 📄 | **Duplicate** selected presentation |
| ❌ | **Remove** selected item |
| ⏮️ | Go to **first** item in the list |
| ◀️ | Go to **previous** item |
| ▶️ | Go to **next** item |
| ⏭️ | Go to **last** item |
| ⬇️ | **Move down** selected item |
| ⬆️ | **Move up** selected item |
| 📑 | **Select visible pages** for a presentation |
| 🎨 | **Edit design** of selected presentation |

---

### Step 4: Managing Presentation Details

- Once you’ve added your presentations, they will appear in a list.
- Each entry shows the **duration**, **page count**, and **settings**.
  
> **Important:**  
> If a presentation contains **dynamic content** like RSS feeds or videos, the duration may appear as `00:01:00 + Automatic`. This indicates an **undeterminable duration**, and the **total playlist duration** will also show as `+ Automatic`.

---

### Step 5: Select Visible Pages (Optional)

You can define which pages from a presentation should be shown in the schedule.

1. Select the presentation in the list.  
2. Click the **Select Visible Pages** icon.  
3. In the **Visible Pages** window, check or uncheck the pages you want included.  
4. Click **OK** to confirm.

Your selection will now be shown in the schedule overview.

---

### Step 6: Set Destination, Time, and Priority

Click **Next** to move to the familiar scheduling options:

- **Destination**: Select a Viewer or Viewer Group  
- **Display Period**: Define start and end date (optionally apply recurrence)  
- **Priority**: Set a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low)

> These steps function the same as in a **Simple Schedule**. For more information, see the *Simple Schedule* section.

---

### Step 7: Finish

Click **Finish** to complete the Playlist Schedule. The scheduled playlist will now be distributed and displayed on the selected destination.
