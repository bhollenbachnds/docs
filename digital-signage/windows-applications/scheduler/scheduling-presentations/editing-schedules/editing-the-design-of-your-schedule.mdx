PADS4 Scheduler allows you to **edit the design of any scheduled presentation** at any time. Once the design is updated, PADS4 automatically ensures the **changes are applied immediately** to the affected schedule.

This functionality is ideal for making live updates to content without needing to recreate or reschedule it.
