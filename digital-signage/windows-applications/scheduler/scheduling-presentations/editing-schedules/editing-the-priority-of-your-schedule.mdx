When schedules **overlap in time**, the one with the **higher priority** is displayed. If multiple overlapping schedules share the same priority level, the system uses **sub priority** to determine which schedule takes precedence.

For more on how priority works, refer to the **Priorities** section.

> **Note:** If access permissions are configured in your system, certain priority-related functions may be **hidden or disabled** based on your user role.

## Editing the Main Priority Level

You can modify a schedule’s priority using either the **ribbon bar** or the **context menu**. The example below demonstrates how to use the context menu.

### Steps:

1. In the **Destinations tree view** (left panel), select the Viewer or Viewer Group containing the schedule.

2. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, locate the schedule you want to adjust.

3. **Right-click** the schedule, then hover over the **Priority** menu item.

4. From the submenu, choose:
   - **Increase** – to raise the priority level
   - **Decrease** – to lower the priority level

Once selected, the **priority of the schedule** is updated immediately.

## Editing the Sub Priority

If two or more schedules have the **same priority level**, you can adjust their **sub priority** to control which one takes precedence. Sub priority is based on the **creation time** of the schedule but can be manually adjusted.

### Steps:

1. In the **Destinations tree view**, select the Viewer or Viewer Group.

2. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, locate the schedule you want to adjust.

3. **Right-click** the schedule, hover over the **Priority** menu, then go to the **Importance** submenu.

4. Choose:
   - **Increase** – to boost the sub priority (makes it more likely to be shown)
   - **Decrease** – to lower the sub priority

The **sub priority of the schedule** is adjusted accordingly.
