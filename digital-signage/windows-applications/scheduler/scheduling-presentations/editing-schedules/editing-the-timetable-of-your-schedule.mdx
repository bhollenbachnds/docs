The **Timetable** functionality in PADS4 Scheduler allows you to manage multiple scheduled entries within a single schedule. By enabling **Advanced Mode**, even a Simple or Playlist Schedule can be edited and expanded into a **multi-destination, multi-period** schedule—essentially turning it into an **Advanced Schedule**.

---

## Accessing the Timetable

To edit the timetable of a schedule:

1. Open the **Edit Schedule** window for the desired schedule.
2. Navigate to the **Timetable** tab.
3. Click **Switch to Advanced Mode**.

This will reveal the **Timetable view**, enabling detailed management of schedule entries.

> **Note:** If access permissions are applied, some destinations or priority levels may be hidden or disabled based on your user rights.

## Timetable Screen Overview

The screen is divided into two main areas:

---

### 1. **The Timetable (Top Section)**

Displays a list of scheduled entries with the following columns:

- **From / Until** (display period)
- **Destination**
- **Priority**
- **Recurrence** (if applicable)

#### Toolbar Options:

| **Icon** | **Function**                        |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| ➕       | **Add New Item**                    |
| ❌       | **Remove Selected Item**            |
| 📄       | **Copy Selected Item**              |
| ⏮️       | Go to **First Entry**               |
| ◀️       | Go to **Previous Entry**            |
| ▶️       | Go to **Next Entry**                |
| ⏭️       | Go to **Last Entry**                |
| 🔼       | **Maximize** timetable area         |
| 🔽       | **Minimize** timetable area         |
| 🔁       | **Restore** default split view size |

Use these tools to navigate and manage multiple schedule entries efficiently.

---

### 2. **Individual Schedule Entry (Bottom Section)**

When you select an item in the timetable, its details appear below:

- **Destination**: Select the Viewer or Viewer Group  
- **Display Period**: Set the start and end time  
- **Priority**: Choose the display priority  
- **Recurrence**: (Optional) Add or edit recurrence patterns

This section provides the same controls and layout as used in **Simple** and **Playlist Schedules**.

> You can manage as many timetable entries as needed, allowing a single schedule to target different content, destinations, times, or even priorities.

---

## Permissions & Access Control

- If **user permissions** are applied, only destinations with at least **read access** will be displayed.  
- You can only assign to destinations for which you have **write access**.  
- You’ll only see **priority levels** that your user account is authorized to use.

---
