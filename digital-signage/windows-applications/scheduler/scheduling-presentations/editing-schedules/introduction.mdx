At any time, you can **modify an existing schedule** in PADS4 Scheduler. This allows you to adjust:

- **Where** the presentation is displayed (Destination)  
- **When** it is displayed (Display Period / Recurrence)  
- The **Priority** of the schedule  
- The **Content** of the presentation

> **Note:**  
> If **access permissions** are in place, you may only have rights to modify specific destinations or priority levels. In such cases, some options may be hidden or disabled based on your role.

### 3. Using Drag & Drop (for Rescheduling)

You can visually move a schedule to a new date using drag and drop:

1. Hover over the schedule  
2. **Click and hold** the mouse button  
3. **Drag** the schedule to a new date in the calendar view
