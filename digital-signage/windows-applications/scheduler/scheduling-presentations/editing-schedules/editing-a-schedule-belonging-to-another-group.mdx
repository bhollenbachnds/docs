In environments with complex **hierarchical Destination structures**, it can be difficult to track where a schedule was originally created—especially when viewing individual **Viewers** within a **Viewer Group**.

To simplify this, **PADS4 Scheduler** provides a quick mechanism to identify and navigate to the **original Destination** where a schedule resides, making editing fast and efficient.

## Example Scenario

- A schedule has been created for a **Viewer Group** called **1stFloor**.
- A **Viewer** named **1stFloorViewer01** is part of this group.

When you select the **1stFloorViewer01** in the **Destinations tree**, you'll see that the **group-level schedule** (from *1stFloor*) is **visible** in the Calendar or Table view.

> You can tell the schedule belongs to a group and **not** the individual Viewer because the schedule **displays the name of the original Destination** in its description (e.g., “1stFloor”).

---

## Attempting to Edit the Schedule

If you attempt to **edit the schedule directly** from the Viewer level (e.g., 1stFloorViewer01), the action will be **blocked**, as the schedule does **not belong** to that Viewer—it belongs to the Viewer Group.

---

## Quickly Navigate to the Correct Destination

To edit the schedule, you must navigate to the **Viewer Group** where the schedule was originally created.

### Steps:

1. **Right-click** the schedule that belongs to another group.
2. Select **Go to Destination of Schedule** from the context menu.

PADS4 Scheduler will automatically switch the selection to the correct **Viewer Group** (e.g., 1stFloor).

From there, you can:

- **Edit the schedule**
- **Change its content, destination, time, or priority**
- **Apply or update recurrence settings**

This feature greatly improves efficiency when working in systems with nested or multi-level destination structures, helping ensure changes are made in the right context.
