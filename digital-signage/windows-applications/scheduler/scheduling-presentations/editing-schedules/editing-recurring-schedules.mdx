When you edit a **recurring schedule**, PADS4 Scheduler allows you to choose whether to:

- Edit the **entire series**, or  
- Modify only a **single occurrence** of that series

This flexibility allows you to maintain consistency across a schedule while making occasional one-off adjustments as needed.

> **Note:**  
> If access permissions are in place, some destination and priority options may be **restricted or hidden** based on your user rights.

## Option 1: Edit the **Entire Series**

This option lets you modify all occurrences of the schedule in one step.

### Steps:

1. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, **right-click** the recurring schedule you wish to edit.
2. Hover over **Edit**, then select **Series** from the submenu.

The **Edit Schedule** window opens, showing general schedule settings.

- You can update standard properties like:
  - **Destination**
  - **Priority**
  - **Display Period**
  - **Playlist content**

3. Click the **Recurrence** button to open the **Recurrence Settings** window.

4. Modify the recurrence pattern as needed.

5. Click **OK** to apply the recurrence changes.  
6. Click **OK** again to apply all schedule changes.

> Your updates will now apply to **all future and past instances** of the recurring schedule.

## Option 2: Edit a **Single Occurrence**

This option allows you to adjust just **one specific instance** of a recurring schedule.

### Steps:

1. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, **right-click** the specific occurrence you want to change.
2. Hover over **Edit**, then select **Occurrence** from the submenu.

The **Edit Occurrence** window will open.

- You can adjust the **display period** and other basic details for that instance.

3. Click **OK** to apply the change to this occurrence only.

> The schedule will now show a **Recurrence Exception**. This means the occurrence is still part of the series but has a modified configuration.

---

## Important: Managing Exceptions

**Changes to the series will still affect exceptions unless explicitly removed.**

If you want to **fully disconnect an occurrence** from the recurring schedule:

1. **Delete** the occurrence.
2. **Manually create** a new **Simple Schedule** to replace it.

This ensures the new entry is completely **independent** of the original recurring series.
