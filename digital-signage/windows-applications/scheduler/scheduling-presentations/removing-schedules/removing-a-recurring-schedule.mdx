PADS4 Scheduler allows you to remove **recurring schedules** in two distinct ways:

- **Delete an Occurrence** – Removes only a single instance of the recurring schedule.
- **Delete the Series** – Removes the **entire recurrence definition** and all associated occurrences.

> **Important Distinction**  
> - **Remove Recurrence**: Deletes the recurrence pattern and converts the selected occurrence into a **standalone schedule**. All other occurrences are removed.  
> - **Delete Series**: Deletes the **entire recurring schedule**, including the recurrence settings **and all occurrences**.

### Using the Ribbon Bar
