PADS4 Scheduler provides clipboard functionality that allows you to **cut**, **copy**, and **paste** schedules across different **Viewers** or **Viewer Groups**. This feature helps streamline workflows when duplicating or moving schedules throughout your display network.

## Cutting and Pasting a Schedule

Cutting a schedule removes it from its current location and places it on the clipboard. When pasted, it becomes a **new, standalone schedule** at the new destination.

### Steps:

1. In the **Destinations tree view**, select the **Viewer** or **Viewer Group** that contains the existing schedule.
2. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, select the schedule you want to move.
3. Navigate to the **Home** tab in the ribbon bar.
4. In the **Clipboard** group, click **Cut**.
5. A confirmation message will appear. Confirm the action to remove the original schedule.
6. Navigate to the new **Viewer** or **Viewer Group**, and select the desired location.
7. Click **Paste** in the **Clipboard** group.

The schedule will be added to the new location as a new, independent schedule.

To verify:
- Right-click the newly pasted schedule
- Choose **Edit > Schedule**
- The **Edit Schedule** window will display a single-entry timetable

## Copying and Pasting a Schedule

Copying a schedule keeps the original intact and adds a **new occurrence** to the same schedule, creating or expanding a **multi-entry timetable**, similar to an **Advanced Schedule**.

### Steps:

1. In the **Destinations tree view**, select the Viewer or Viewer Group with the schedule you want to copy.
2. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, select the schedule.
3. In the **Home** tab, click **Copy** in the **Clipboard** group.
4. Navigate to the desired destination and position.
5. Click **Paste**.

The copied schedule is now an additional entry within the same schedule object.

To verify:
- Right-click the pasted schedule
- Choose **Edit > Schedule**
- The **Edit Schedule** window will show multiple timetable entries
