PADS4 Scheduler allows you to use **cut**, **copy**, and **paste** operations on **recurring schedules**, making it easy to move or duplicate them across different **Viewers** or **Viewer Groups**. The behavior of these actions differs slightly from regular (non-recurring) schedules.

## Cutting and Pasting a Recurring Schedule

When you **cut and paste** a recurring schedule, a **new schedule** is created at the destination, and the original is removed.

### Steps:

1. In the **Destinations tree view**, select the **Viewer** or **Viewer Group** that contains the recurring schedule.

2. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, select the recurring schedule.

3. Navigate to the **Home** tab in the ribbon bar and click **Cut** in the **Clipboard** group.

4. A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm that you want to delete the recurring schedule.

   - The schedule is removed from the original location.
   - A copy remains in the clipboard, ready to be pasted.

5. Navigate to the new destination and select the desired position.

6. Click **Paste** in the **Clipboard** group.

The recurring schedule is now created as a **new, independent schedule** at the destination.

To confirm:
- Right-click the pasted schedule
- Select **Edit > Schedule**
- The **Edit Schedule** window will show it as a new recurrence definition

## Copying and Pasting a Recurring Schedule

When you **copy and paste** a recurring schedule, it creates a **new timetable entry** within the original schedule object, assuming the schedule type supports multiple destinations or time slots (e.g., an Advanced Schedule).

### Steps:

1. In the **Destinations tree view**, select the **Viewer** or **Viewer Group** that contains the recurring schedule.

2. In the **Calendar** or **Table** view, select the recurring schedule.

3. Click **Copy** from the **Clipboard** group in the ribbon bar.

4. Navigate to the new date or Viewer where the schedule should be duplicated.

5. Click **Paste**.

The recurring schedule is now added as a **new entry in the scheduleâ€™s timetable**.

To confirm:
- Right-click the pasted schedule
- Select **Edit > Schedule**
- The **Edit Schedule** window will show multiple entries, including the new one
