The **Content Library** is a centralized storage mechanism in PADS4, introduced to streamline content management and synchronization across multiple devices and users, such as Designers, Schedulers, and Viewers.

It enables the storage and distribution of:

- Presentations  
- Images  
- Videos  
- Other media assets

This centralized repository is hosted on the **PADS4 Server** and features a folder structure similar to **Windows Explorer**, allowing for flexible and intuitive organization.

> For a detailed explanation of managing content and folders, refer to the **PADS4 Content Organizer Manual**.
