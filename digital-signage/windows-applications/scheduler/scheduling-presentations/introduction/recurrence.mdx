In many cases, a scheduled presentation needs to be repeated regularlyâ€”daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly. Rather than manually creating multiple schedules, **PADS4 Scheduler** provides a powerful **Set Recurrence** feature to automate these repeating schedules.

The **recurrence pattern** defines how and when the schedule repeats over time.

## Why Use Recurrence?

- Efficiently manage **repeating events**  
- Avoid duplication of schedule entries  
- Precisely control **when and how often** content appears

Examples of recurring schedules include:

- Daily content updates  
- Weekly meeting room signage  
- Monthly promotional content  
- Annual announcements  
- Events recurring every 4 years (e.g., Olympic coverage)

## Recurrence Components

A recurrence pattern is defined by **three main aspects**:

---

### 1. **Start Date and End Criterion**

You control when a recurring schedule begins and ends:

- **Start Date**: The date the recurrence starts  
- **End Criterion**:
  - **By End Date**: Ends on a specified date  
  - **By Number of Occurrences**: Ends after a set number of repeats  
  - **Never Ending**: Continues indefinitely until manually changed or deleted

### 2. **Recurrence Type**

There are **four recurrence types**, each with its own configuration options:

| Recurrence Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Daily**        | Repeats every day or every few days (e.g., every 2 days) |
| **Weekly**       | Repeats on specific weekdays (e.g., Monday and Friday) |
| **Monthly**      | Repeats on specific days (e.g., 15th) or patterns (e.g., second Tuesday) |
| **Yearly**       | Repeats once per year or at a custom annual interval |

Each recurrence type offers flexibility to match your scheduling needs.

### 3. **Specifics Within One Day**

This determines **when during each day** the presentation should be displayed.

You can specify:

- **Start and End Time**: The time window during the day when the content is shown  
- **Time Segments** *(Optional)*:
  - **Uninterrupted**: Displayed continuously throughout the selected time range  
  - **On an Hourly Basis**: Shown several minutes at specific intervals every hour  
  - **On a Minute Basis**: Fine-tuned minute-level control over presentation slots

---

By combining these three elements, **PADS4 Scheduler** enables robust recurring schedules tailored to your content and audience timing.
