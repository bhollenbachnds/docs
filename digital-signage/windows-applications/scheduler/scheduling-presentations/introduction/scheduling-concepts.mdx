Scheduling presentations in **PADS4 Scheduler** is based on three essential elements:

1. **Content**  
2. **Location**  
3. **Time**

Understanding how these elements interact is key to effective content planning and distribution across your digital signage network.

## 1. Content

In PADS4, **content** refers to the media and design elements that make up a presentation. This can include:

- Videos  
- Images  
- Text  
- Interactive elements  
- Any combination of the above

Content is created using **PADS4 Designer** and saved as a `.padsx` file. This file may be stored:

- Locally on disk  
- On a network drive  
- In **PADS4 Content Organizer**  
- Or sent directly to the **PADS4 Server**

> **Important:**  
> There is a clear distinction between the **original `.padsx` file** and the **scheduled presentation copy**:
> - When you schedule a `.padsx` file, **PADS4 Scheduler creates a copy** and uploads it to the **PADS4 Server**.  
> - From that moment, the server copy becomes independent. Changes to the original design file **will not affect the scheduled copy**.

## 2. Location

Once your content is created, it must be assigned to a **display location**.

In PADS4, physical display devices are abstracted as **Destinations**. These can be:

- Individual **Viewers** (displays)  
- **Viewer Groups**  
- Multiple independent Destinations

Destinations are configured and managed in **PADS4 System Management**. The Scheduler provides an up-to-date list of accessible Destinations based on your user permissions.

You can schedule content to:

- A **single Destination**  
- An entire **group of Destinations**  
- A **custom selection** of unrelated Destinations

## 3. Time

The final component of scheduling is determining **when** your content should be shown.

PADS4 Scheduler provides flexible time management options:

- Schedule a presentation for a **specific time period**  
- Create **recurrence rules** for repetitive display cycles (e.g., daily, weekly)  
- Combine multiple time patterns for more complex scheduling scenarios

Whether you need to display content once, daily at specific hours, or on a recurring monthly basis, PADS4 Scheduler offers the tools to meet those needs.

With these three core concepts—**Content, Location, and Time**—you can build highly customized and efficient schedules to power your digital signage strategy.
