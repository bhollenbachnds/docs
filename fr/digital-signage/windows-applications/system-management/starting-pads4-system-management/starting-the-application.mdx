  If all configuration settings of the application are correct then the system will automatically connect to the PADS4 Server software. If you start the application for the very first time or when one or more of the configuration settings are incorrect (the system is not able to connect to the PADS4 Server software) then the PADS4 connection management window will automatically be shown. This allows you to specify the right configuration settings in order to connect to the PADS4 Server software and thus start the application.
