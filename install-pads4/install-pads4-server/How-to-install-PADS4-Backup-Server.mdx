## **Pre-Installation Considerations**  
Before starting the PADS4 installation, ensure the following prerequisites are met:  

1. If you plan to use **Workspace** and/or **CMS**, verify that **Internet Information Services (IIS)** is installed on the server.  
2. If you intend to store **Workspace** and/or **CMS data** in a **SQL Server database**, ensure SQL Server is installed and configured.  

<Note>It is recommended to disable virus scanners before starting the installation or update process. Some antivirus programs may interfere with installation, leading to "could not lock file" errors.</Note>

## **Important Installation Considerations**  

<Warning>  
âš  **Do NOT install PADS4 Foundation on a workstation or Viewer PC.**  
- **PADS4 Foundation** should only be installed on **server machines**.  
- Installing **PADS4 Foundation** on a **workstation/Viewer PC** (configured only for **PADS4 Designer, Scheduler, or Messenger**) will activate **server functionality**, altering its configuration.  
- However, once **PADS4 Foundation** is installed on a **server**, you can install **PADS4 Client software** (e.g., **Scheduler, Designer, Messenger**) on the same machine if needed.  
</Warning>
