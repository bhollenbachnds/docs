## Configuring a Backup Server

To configure a Back-up Server, complete the following steps in PADS4 System Management on the Main Server:​

1. Open **PADS4 System Management** on the Main Server.
2. In the left menu, select **Servers**.​
3. In the ribbon bar, click **Add Backup Server**.
4. Enter a **display name** for the Sub Server as it should appear in PADS4.
6. Verify that a **valid license** is assigned to the Sub Server.

## Network Port Configuration

PADS4 uses specific network ports for its internal communication and services. Refer to the [**Network Ports Configuration**](/network-requirements) page for the full list of required ports and settings.

For more details on how data is synchronized between Main, Sub, and Backup Servers, see the [**Replication with Sub and Backup Servers**](/network-requirements) page.
