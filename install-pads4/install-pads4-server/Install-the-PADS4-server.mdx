<Warning>
  Never install PADS4 Foundation on a workstation or Viewer PC intended only for client apps like Designer, Scheduler, or Messenger. Doing so adds server functionality, reconfiguring it as a server machine and potentially disrupting client operations. After Foundation installation, you can add PADS4 client software on that server-classified PC.
