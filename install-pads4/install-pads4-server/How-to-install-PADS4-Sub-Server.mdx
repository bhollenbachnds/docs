The installation process matches the PADS4 Server setup. See Install PADS4 Server and run the installer.

## Configuring a Sub Server

If installing a **Sub Server**, follow these steps in **PADS4 System Management** on the **Main Server**:

1. Open **PADS4 System Management**.
2. Select **Servers** from the left menu.
3. Click **"Add Sub Server"** in the ribbon bar.
4. Enter a **name** to be displayed in the **PADS4 Agent** for this Sub Server.
5. Configure the **network settings** for the Main Server to communicate with the Sub Server.
6. Ensure a **valid license** is assigned to the Sub Server.

For further details, refer to the **PADS4 Scheduler Manual**, available during the **Windows Clients installation**.

## Network Port Configuration

PADS4 requires specific network ports for communication. Refer to the [**Network Ports Configuration**](#) page for details.

For additional information on synchronization, visit the [**Replication with Sub and Backup Servers**](#) page.

## Important Installation Considerations

<Warning>
  Do NOT install PADS4 Foundation on a Workstation or Viewer PC.
</Warning>

- **PADS4 Foundation** should only be installed on **server machines**.
- Installing **PADS4 Foundation** on a **workstation/Viewer PC** (configured only for **PADS4 Designer, Scheduler, or Messenger**) will enable **server functionality**, altering its configuration.

**However, after installing PADS4 Foundation on a server machine,** you may proceed with the installation of **PADS4 Client applications** on the same system if needed.
