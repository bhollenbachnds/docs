## Important Installation Considerations

<Warning>Do NOT install PADS4 Foundation on a Workstation or Viewer PC.</Warning>
- **PADS4 Foundation** should only be installed on **server machines**.  
- Installing **PADS4 Foundation** on a **workstation/Viewer PC** (configured only for **PADS4 Designer, Scheduler, or Messenger**) will enable **server functionality**, altering its configuration.  

**However, after installing PADS4 Foundation on a server machine,** you may proceed with the installation of **PADS4 Client applications** on the same system if needed.
