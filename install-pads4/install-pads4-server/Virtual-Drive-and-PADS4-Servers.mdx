# Upgrading to PADS4 Version 2021.3 and Higher

With the release of **PADS4 version 2021.3**, a new **Advanced Content Library System** has been introduced. This update enhances functionality and security by transitioning from an open folder structure to a controlled environment. As a result, existing installations may require minor adjustments to accommodate this change.  

---

## PADS4 Advanced Content Library 

Starting from **PADS4 version 2021.3**, the content library is no longer stored within the traditional directory path:  

```
C:\ProgramData\PADS\Content\...
```  

Instead, it is now managed within a **closed environment**, enabling PADS4 to introduce advanced features and improved security while maintaining seamless content management.

## PADS4 Virtual Drive on PADS4 (Sub/Backup) Servers

When using **PADS4 Designer**, **Data Folder Data Providers**, **PADS4 CMS**, or **PADS4 Workspace**, the system now utilizes a **Virtual Drive** as a gateway to the new closed content environment.  

For existing installations that rely on the traditional **Content Library folder**, compatibility is maintained through this mechanism. The **Virtual Drive** is automatically installed during the upgrade process.  

### Performance Considerations
Users may experience a slight change in performance, as the **Virtual Drive** retrieves content dynamically from the closed environment instead of a direct file system structure.  

---

## How Does It Work? 

When installing **PADS4 Server version 2021.3 or higher**, a **Virtual Drive Service** is automatically deployed. This service provides seamless integration with the new **Advanced Content Library**.  

### Navigating the Virtual Drive 
After upgrading, you may notice that the previous content library folder:  

```
C:\ProgramData\PADS\Content\...
```  

is now represented as a **Virtual Folder** (indicated by an arrow on the folder icon). You can still open and interact with it as you would with a normal folder.  

### Functionality
Although the folder appears to contain files, no actual data is stored locally. Instead, the system dynamically retrieves and displays file information from the **PADS4 Server**. Users can:  
- **Add, edit, and delete files**  
- **Open files for editing and save changes directly**  
- **Synchronize changes automatically with the PADS4 Server**  

Additionally, any new files uploaded via the **PADS4 Web Portal** will appear in the **Virtual Drive** folder.

## Log File Location
For troubleshooting and log analysis, the **Virtual Drive Service** maintains a dedicated log file. You can find it here:  

```
C:\Program Files\NDS\PADS4 Foundation\NDS.Content.FileSystem.Service\NDS.Content.FileSystem.Service.log
```

## API for Content Management 

With **PADS4 version 2021.3**, a new **Content Management API** has been introduced, replacing the previous **Agent SDK**. This API provides improved functionality and flexibility for managing content programmatically.  

For further details and implementation examples, refer to the **PADS4 API Documentation on GitHub**.

## Content Library and Viewers

The mechanism for syncing **Viewers** remains unchanged in this update. Existing processes for content synchronization and playback will continue to function as before.
