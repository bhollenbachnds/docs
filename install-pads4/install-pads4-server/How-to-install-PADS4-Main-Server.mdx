Important

<Warning>It is of vital importance that you do not install the PADS4 Foundation on a workstation / Viewer PC (that is only configured for Designer/Scheduler/Messenger etc.). This will install PADS4 Server functionality on your workstation / Viewer PC, as this would result in setting up the configuration as a Server PC. It is however possible to install the PADS4 Clients software after installing the PADS4 Foundation installation as the machine is then already classified as a Server PC.</Warning>
