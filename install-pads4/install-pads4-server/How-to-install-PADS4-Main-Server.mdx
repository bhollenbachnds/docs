## **Download the PADS4 Installer**

Download the PADS4 Installer Setup from [here](https://docs.pads4.com/install-pads4/Downloads).​

**Pre-Installation Checks**

- Before installing the PADS4 product, verify prerequisites based on your setup. If using Workspace and/or CMS, ensure Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed on the server.
- For storing Workspace and/or CMS data in a SQL Server database, confirm SQL Server is installed on the server.

<Note>
  Please disable virus scanners before starting the installation or update process. There is a possibility that you will receive a "could not lock file" message during update because of a virusscanner.
</Note>

## Installation process

Install PADS4 by following these numbered steps, ensuring you run as Administrator.​

1. Right-click the installer file and select "Run as administrator."
2. Change the installation root folder if needed (default: C:\\Program Files\\PADS4).​
3. Read the installation document and license agreement, then check the boxes.​
4. Check boxes to confirm and press Install to begin.​

Upon completing the PADS4 installation, the PADS4 Configuration application automatically opens. Use it to set hosting ports, database options, and server settings.

### Error during installation

If an error occurs during PADS4 installation, a pop-up window appears with a "click HERE" link to the generated log file. This log records every step of the process, aiding in problem diagnosis. Share it with support if issues persist.

<Warning>
  Never install PADS4 Foundation on a workstation or Viewer PC intended only for client apps like Designer, Scheduler, or Messenger. Doing so adds server functionality, reconfiguring it as a server machine and potentially disrupting client operations. After Foundation installation, you can add PADS4 client software on that server-classified PC.
